        v1 = self.conv_transpose(x1)
        v2 = self.sigmoid(v1)
        v3 = v1 * v2
        return v3

```
The model class in the second example is named Model2 and it is defined to contain a transposed convolution layer and a sigmoid activation layer. The forward method is defined to accept an input tensor of size (1, 8, 128, 128), perform the operation equivalent to the described pattern, and return the output of the operation. The output of this model (which is stored in __output2__) is a tensor of the same size as the input tensor passed into the model.
The input tensor x2 for the newly generated model is a 4D tensor of random values, having shape (1, 8, 128, 128). The variables used to compute the input tensor (__output2__) are the model (Model2) and the tensor x2.
