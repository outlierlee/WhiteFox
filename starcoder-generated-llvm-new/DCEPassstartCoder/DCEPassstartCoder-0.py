```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int x = -100; // Initialize x with a negative value
  int unused_var = 0; // Unused variable

  if (x < 0) {
    unused_var = x * 2; // This results in dead code
  } else {
    unused_var = x + 2; // This makes the variable used, breaking dead code elimination
  }

  int y = 20; // Initialize y with a concrete value
  int z = -5; // Initialize z with a negative value

  std::cout << y + z << std::endl; // this prevents y and z from being optimized out

  return 0; // Return 0 to ensure the program has a meaningful exit status
}
```

The C++ version of the requirement cannot be generated directly because C++ doesn't have a direct equivalent for dead code elimination. C++ compilers can perform certain dead code elimination, such as when the function isn't "reached" due to an exception, but in this particular case - where x is not used after it's calculated - elimination is based on the control flow in the code, which goes against optimum program flow in the original requirement.
