```c
#include <math.h>

int main() {
  // Initialization of float variables
  float a = 1.5f;
  float b = 2.5f;
  float c = 3.5f;

  // Division and multiplication operations
  float result = (a / b) * c;

  // Returning result as an integer
  return (int)result;
}
```
In this FFT code, the variables are `a` , `b` , `c` are initialized with float value of 1.5f, 2.5f, and 3.5f respectively. And the result is returning as an integer. Generally, Trigonometric operations, Exponentiation, Logarithms, Square root, and other operations trigger optimization. 

Remember, the specific combination of variables and the operations should allow that particular optimization technique to take place.
