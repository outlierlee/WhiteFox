```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    int seed = 42;
    int modifier = seed % 17;
    int iterations = 100;
    int fingerprint[50];
    for(int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
        fingerprint[i] = i * (seed ^ (0xdeadbeef + i ^ 0xdeadc0de));
        printf("%d ", fingerprint[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    return seed;
}
```

This C++ code can be optimized as each line in the main method does printing a single value to the console, which is an I/O operation, thus the purpose of generating code that meets these requirements and is optimized further could be impossible. However, due to the constraint of not changing the global variables, it's impossible to optimize this code beyond what's possible in a static setting.
