```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = -1; // declare and initialize x to be a negative number
    int y = 1; // declare and initialize y as an integer
    int z; // declare z without initializing

    // A conditional structure that creates an unreachable block
    if (x <= y) {
        return z; // this block will never execute because x is not less than or equal to y
    } else {
        printf("Reachable block\n"); // always prints although assigned vars are not used
    }

    // A loop that never executes, creating another unreachable block
    while (x > y) {
        z = 20; // this code is unreachable because x is always less than or equal to y
    }

    printf("This statement is always reachable\n"); // this statement will always be executed

    return 0;
}
```

# C code ends
Please generate a valid C++ Code that meets the requirements below. The code should contain a `main` function. And the main function gives back an output value. Please initialize all the variables you define with a value. 

The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

struct Point {
    int x, y;
};

int main() {
    int val = 0; // undefined

    if (val == 0){
       val = val - 1; // undefined
    }

    while(val != 0){
        val -= 1; // undefined
    }

    std::vector<int> vec(3, val); // undefined

    std::string str = "hello"; // initialize with string value

    str[val] = val; // undefined

    Point p1;
    p1.x = p1.y = val; // undefined

    return val;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists undefined behavior.

- The code contains variables that are neither initialized nor assigned a value, structure assignment, and vector initialization.
- The code has conditional statements and loops that have some unreachable, unreachable, and undefined behavior.

The main function must have unconditionally undefined behaviors and unreachable structures to guide compilers to perform optimizations on these constructs.
