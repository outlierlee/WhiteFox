This task requires knowledge how One Device and Cross Device operations work, the Physical Devices property of distributed strategies, logging statement in TensorFlow. Here is an idea for the model's description.

```python
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    tf.distribute.experimental.set_strategy('one_device')
    t1 = tf.distribute.experimental.all_reduce(x1, reduction='minimum')
    
    # here it will be dist.device('/device:CPU:0)') so we can switch back to CPU
    tf.distribute.experimental.set_strategy(None) 
    
    t2 = tf.distribute.experimental.all_gather([t1], axis=0)
    
    with tf.device('/CPU:0'):
      return t2

m = Model()
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

y = m(x1)
```

This `Model` uses `tf.distribute.all_gather` and `tf.distribute.experimental.all_reduce`. The operators will be placed onto different physical devices ('/device:CPU:0' or '/device:GPU:0') that they are supporting. The XLA pass `AllReduceSimplifier` would then be able to identify when this pattern is present in the graph, and simplify it.
