```python
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()
    
  def call(self, x):
    x = tf.distribute.all_gather(x, axis=0)
    x = tf.distribute.experimental.reducescatter(x, reduction='sum')
    x = tf.distribute.experimental.all_reduce(x, reduction='minimum')
    return x
```
  
Note: The `tf.distribute.all_gather` should be used in place of the `tf.concat` to create and perform an all-gather. After simulation, the model will use the AllReduceSimplifier pass on `tf.distribute.experimental.all_reduce` operations, as these are equivalent to the collective operations it aims to achieve.
