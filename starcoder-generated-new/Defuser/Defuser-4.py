Please generate a valid TensorFlow model that fits the profile below:

```python
@tf.function(experimental_compile=True)
def model(x):
    # Your implementation here...
```

In the needed model, the operations to be combined would need to be displayed within tf.function as given above. This function takes an argument x (could be of any shape) and returns the result as per your implementation. The use of Variables or any special TensorFlow features is optional, while the entire model must be encapsulated within the declared function. 

# Hint:
You can use add and multiply operations. Addition can be of the form: `t1 = tf.add(x, x)` and multiplication can be done as: `t2 = tf.multiply(t1, t1)`. 

The purpose of the problem is to generate a valid TensorFlow model that fits this profile and triggers the `Defuser` optimization in TensorFlow XLA.
