This output verification indicates that once the number of operands exceeds the threshold, the optimizer will combine AllGather operations connected to each other. Please enter this code in your tensorflow environment or install tensorflow in your environment and execute it.

Please keep in mind, however, that `tf.distribute.AllGather` is only valid in a distributed setting (TensorFlow's default distributed strategy), and it's designed for collective communications. In a normal, non-distributed TensorFlow environment, it will throw an error.
