Note: The optimization pass depends on the underlying strategy of the model. For example, if we're using MirroredStrategy to construct the model, then different partitions of the data will be placed on different devices (like GPUs). Thus, for the optimization pass `AllGatherCombiner` to work, the replicas placed on these devices need to be running at the same code and the input tensors satisfy all constraints. 

And, the values returned by `tf.distribute.experimental.AllGather(x,i)` depend on the value of `i`, the dimension along which the AllGather is performed. In this model `tf.distribute.experimental.AllGather` is performed along the 0, 1, and 2 dimensions of the input tensor `x`. Each such call will result in a tensor with a shape corresponding to the new axis and an additional dimension added to it. These tensors are combined to form the result. So, since the model combines tensors along dimensions 0, 1, 2 we need a tensor with rank (n in general) where n >= 4 or else we will get an error. So make sure input shapes and dimension selected for all gather are compatible for the optimization pass `AllGatherCombiner`.
