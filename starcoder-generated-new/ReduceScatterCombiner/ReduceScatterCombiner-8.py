Create several tensors of different shapes and data types whose total size exceeds `combine_threshold_in_bytes` (for example, choose 4 tensors with sizes 1GB, 2GB, 1.5GB, and 1.6GB). Then create the ReduceScatter operation with each of these tensors as an operand (total number) and set the reduction operation to `add`.

For instance, the below example is for single ReduceScatter operation satisfying the conditions:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x1 = tf.random.uniform([1024, 1024,1024], minval=0, maxval=20, dtype=tf.int32)
y1 = tf.raw_ops.ReduceScatter(input=x1, reduction_op='add', replica_ids=[0], max_replicas=1, group_assignment=[0], sharding_config=[])
```

The above code should trigger the optimizer.

Note: The specific details about the conditions and properties depend on the Tensorflow version. The code in this problem description is in response to the specific requirements of the question rather than a specific use-case for machine learning or deep learning.
