The model class should contain new methods called `AddOp`, `to_type_map_`, and `op_matcher_`. These are placeholders. They need to be matched with appropriate functions to define the logic for the `ChangeOpDataType` optimization pass. These functions are a part of TensorFlow's optimization framework.

Please define these functions and add them to the class model. I will call the `AddOp` method to add your specific operator to the model. 

Please rewrite the model class below to meet these specifications.

class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()
    
    # Placeholders for new methods.
    self.AddOp = None
    self.to_type_map_ = None
    self.op_matcher_ = None

  def call(self, x):
    if self.AddOp is None:
      raise AttributeError("Please add a new operator using the AddOp method.")
    if self.to_type_map_ is None:
      raise AttributeError("Please set the to_type_map_ attribute.")
    if self.op_matcher_ is None:
      raise AttributeError("Please set the op_matcher_ attribute.")

    # Implement the logic of your operator. 
    x = self.AddOp(x)

    return x
