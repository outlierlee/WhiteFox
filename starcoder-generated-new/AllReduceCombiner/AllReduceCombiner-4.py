```python
class Model(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self, num_inputs):
    super(Model, self).__init__()
    self.allreduce_ops = [tf.reduce_sum] * num_inputs

  def call(self, tensors):
    reduced_tensors = []
    for op, tensor in zip(self.allreduce_ops, tensors):
      reduced_tensors.append(op(tensor))
    return reduced_tensors

model = Model(num_inputs)
input_tensors = [tf.ones([4, 4])] * num_inputs
output = model(input_tensors)
```
In the above model, `num_inputs` is the number of AllReduce operations to be combined.
Please choose a suitable value for `num_inputs` and `input_tensors` for triggering the `AllReduceCombiner` optimization in TensorFlow XLA.

**Note**: You may need to modify the model's construction to fit your specific use case.
 Also, be aware that different levels of TensorFlow operations will require different computing resources and time. Ensure that you have the resources to run the optimization pass utilized here.
