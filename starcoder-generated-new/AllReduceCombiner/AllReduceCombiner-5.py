# Define a model with multiple tf.reduce_sum operations
# ... The model definition would be similar to the given All Reduce operations

class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1, x2):
    t1 = tf.reduce_sum(x1)
    t2 = tf.reduce_sum(x2)
    return t1 + t2

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [2,2]
x1 = tf.constant([[1.,2.],[3.,4.]], shape=input_shape)
x2 = tf.constant([[5.,6.],[7.,8.]], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1, x2)
```

Please note, the contraint of the threshold parameter for combining the operations may affect the output of the model and consequently the optimizations that can be connected to it.
