Assuming we have n total AllReduce operations and the threshold for combining is set to `threshold`.
We will create `n` all_reduce operations with `tf.reduce_sum` operation on each tensor. These tensors will gradually increase their size so that only end up with `num_all_reduce_to_combine` by comparing at the end.

Here's a sample Python code and a TensorFlow model illustrating the problem.

```python
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self, n, threshold):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

    self._input_tensors = [tf.ones([2**i], dtype=tf.float32) for i in range(n)]
    self._n = n
    self._threshold = threshold

  def call(self):

    total = tf.zeros([self._n], dtype=tf.float32)
    zero = tf.zeros([self._n], dtype=tf.float32)

    for i in range(self._n):

      if tf.reduce_sum(total) + tf.reduce_sum(self._input_tensors[i]) > self._threshold:
        # Reset the total if it exceeds the threshold
        total = zero

      total += tf.reduce_sum(self._input_tensors[i])

    return tf.reduce_sum(total)


# Initializing the model
m = Model(100, 1000)

# Call model, this will only trigger the AllReduceCombiner optimization if the threshold is satisfied.
y = m()
```

This Python code defines a class `Model`, which creates `n` input tensors, each tensor size is doubling every time. Then it creates `n` `reduce_sum` operations, if the adding of a tensor results in a total which exceeds the threshold (`1000` here), it zeroes the `total` and start the adding from the next tensor. Finally, it returns the `reduce_sum` of `total`.

In this way in theory it will eventually create multiple `reduce_sum` operations that can be combined into a single operation.
