class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.broadcast_to(x1, [2,2])
    z = tf.zeros([2,2], dtype=tf.int32)
    return tf.raw_ops.AllGather(x2, Tout=tf.int32)

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)
```

# Expected output
You will see some messages or run without exceptions. 
This successful run validates the deep learning model against your carefully crafted XLA optimization pass. 

# Notes
This problem was a part of the coding task given as assignment in FEBRUARY 2023, and it seems it could be interpreted as a simple problem, but I would appreciate more context if there's any. Good luck!
