Please note that in reality, sharding operation is a higher level concept and the simple model above doesn't achieve the sharding effect due to the complexity. Typically, sharding would be handled by hardware (like when using TensorFlow's distribution strategy APIs) and consequently the level of operation details commonly involved in sharding operations (and their optimization passes) would be abstracted away for better generic, high-level usage.
