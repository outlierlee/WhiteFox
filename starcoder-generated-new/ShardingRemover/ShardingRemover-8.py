class Model(tf.keras.Model):

    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.raw_ops.Sharding(input=x1)
    return x2

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

Note: In the real-world scenario of AI, the provided models can be actually much more complicated, involving multiple stages of image processing, data augmentation, etc. Moreover, apply the optimization pass `ShardingRemover` intelligently requires that the provided model is the entry point for the distributed training process. For the purpose of this simplified demonstration, let's keep it simple.
