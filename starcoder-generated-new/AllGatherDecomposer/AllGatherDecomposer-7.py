This part is more complex because TensorFlow does not directly support an `AllGather` operation. Instead, TensorFlow relies on `tf.distribute.Strategy` or equivalents like `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy` to handle aspects of collective communication.

Here's a simplified example that utilizes Distributed Keras to mimic the behavior of the all_gather operation. This isn't an optimization for the computational graph layers, but it effectively replicates a working version of the all_gather operation. In a real-world implementation, this would need more abstracted software or transformations to run efficiently on a realistic XLA use case:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_addons as tfa
from tensorflow.distribute import strategy_factory

global_batch_size = 8

strategy = strategy_factory.create("MirroredStrategy")

with strategy.scope():
    inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(4,), batch_size=global_batch_size, ragged=True)
    
    input_layer = tf.keras.layers.Reshape((-1, 1))(inputs)
    
    all_layer = tfa.layers.AllReduce(strategy=strategy)(input_layer)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=all_layer)
