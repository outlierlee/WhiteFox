`AllGather` operation cannot be generated or described directly with TensorFlow's APIs, so you could refer to an example from TensorFlow Distribution library:

```python
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
tfd = tfp.distributions

def model(all_gather_indices, all_gather_shape, all_gather_value):
  group_assignment = all_gather_indices
  distribute = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
  with distribute.scope():
  
    # Convert gpu indices to a list of int32 tensors.
    gpu_indices = tf.cast(all_gather_indices, tf.int32) if all_gather_indices is not None else None

    all_gather_list = all_gather(group_assignment, gpu_indices, all_gather_value)

    # Concatenate the list to a tensor.
    tensor_all_gathered = tf.concat(all_gather_list, axis=0)
    # Create tensor of the new shape expected by TensorFlow op AllGather.
    tensor_reshaped = tf.reshape(tensor_all_gathered, all_gather_shape)

  return tensor_reshaped
```

Please note, the `AllGatherDecomposer` optmization pass mentioned in your problem isn't about reshaping and can be handled with `tf.reshape` directly, it's more about efficient collective communication which `tf.distribute.AllReduce` does. But that wouldn't work directly with your reshape model.

You'd have to extend TensorFlow or wrap `AllGatherDecomposer` inside Tensorflow's supported optimization passes/decomposer, which isn't a public API and likely subject to change. 

Instead, you could try to analyze and decompose the operations in your model manually or through a custom decomposition pass before XLA compilation.
