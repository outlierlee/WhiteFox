# Following is a simple example of such a model that uses the `tf.raw_ops.AllGather` function to perform the `AllGather` operation. However, the specifics of what conditions trigger the `AllGatherDecomposer` pass (i.e., what combination of operations should be subtracted from the `AllGather`) are not covered in this description nor in the sample code provided. Actual examples would require custom modifications of the optimization triggers. 

class Model(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()
  
  # should_decompose is a supposed placeholder for the specific function that you want to decode.
  def should_decompose(self, x):
    return tf.math.equal(x, 1) 

  def call(self, x):
    x1 = self.should_decompose(x)
    return tf.raw_ops.AllGather(x1, group_key="")
