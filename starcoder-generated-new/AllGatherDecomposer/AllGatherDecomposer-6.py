This description assumes that the required functionality can be implemented through a single operation, i.e., `tf.raw_ops.AllGather`. But for practical usage, it is expected that the logic of decomposing `AllGather` operation can be complex and cannot be expressed by a single operation.

```python
inputs = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4])
outputs, _ = tf.raw_ops.AllGather(inputs=inputs, split=[], collective_dims=[])
```

In reality, the condition to trigger `AllGatherDecomposer` is more complex and depends on the TensorFlow-XLA engine implementation, which is not covered here.
