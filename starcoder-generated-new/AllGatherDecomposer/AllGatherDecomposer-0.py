class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self, should_decompose):
    super(Model, self).__init__()
    self.should_decompose = should_decompose

  def call(self, x, group_assignment):
    return tf.raw_ops.AllGather(x, group_assignment, name=None)

# Creating a broadcast group assignment
group_assignment = [0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3]

# Creating a model instance to trigger the optimizer
model = Model(should_decompose=??? ???)

# Creating an input tensor
input_shape = [2,2,2,2]
x = tf.constant([1.] * 16, shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = model(x, group_assignment)
```
This code serves as a starting point for implementing the model and is unfinished. The should_decompose function is left undefined and needs to be defined elsewhere to complete the code. It should be capable of determining when the AllGather operation should be decomposed, according to the requirements of the specific optimization pass.
