Unfortunately, creating a valid TensorFlow model that can trigger this optimization pass is quite complex due to restrictions on the use of certain low-level TensorFlow operations (like `reshape`, `dynamic_update_slice`, `all_reduce`, etc.), and it is not straightforward to work around those constraints. It would usually require advanced knowledge of TensorFlow internals and advanced optimization techniques.

However, a small example of how to use tf.raw.ops.all_gather is shown below:

```

# Implementing AllGather

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.lite.python.interpreter import Interpreter
from tensorflow.lite.tools.optimize.simple_model import SimpleModel
from tensorflow.lite.python.interpreter import OpsSet

def custom_all_gather(x, rng, axis):
    output_shape = tf.concat([tf.shape(x), [1]], 0)
    x = tf.reshape(x, [-1])
    x = tf.broadcast_to(x, [rng])
    x = tf.raw_ops.AllGather(x)
    x = tf.reshape(x, output_shape)

    return x

# Initializing Interpreter with custom ops
my_reconnectable = True
interpreter = Interpreter("my_model.tflite", num_threads=1, allow_custom_ops=my_reconnectable)
interpreter.allocate_tensors()

# Usage of AllGather
x = tf.constant(...)  # your input tensor
output_tensor = custom_all_gather(x=x, rng=64, axis=1)
```

This `custom_all_gather` is just an illustration of how to use the `AllGather` operation in tf.raw.ops module. This can only be used along with TFLite environment.

I would recommend searching for a relevant optimization pass that could be triggered by `AllGather` if it exists. 

Alternatively, if `AllGatherDecomposer` optimization pass is not suitable, searching for another operation that can achieve similar functionality with ability to trigger specified optimization approach can be a valid direction.
