The `tf.distribute.NcclAllReduce` and `tf.math.segment_sum` can be used to implement the `AllGather` operation, respectively.

```
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()
    self.all_reduce = tf.distribute.NcclAllReduce()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = x1 # reshape process
    x3 = self.all_reduce(x2, group=None)
    x4 = tf.math.segment_sum(x3, [0], name=None)
    x5 = tf.reshape(x4, [2,2])
    return x5
```
This model contains an `AllGather` operation, which could potentially be decomposed if the `should_decompose_` predicate function is implemented correctly.
