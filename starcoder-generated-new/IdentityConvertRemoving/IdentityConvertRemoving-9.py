# Following pattern isn't suitable as TensorFlow XLA optimization pass RemoveIdentityRemoving is not identity preserving and `Identity` - part of Tensorflow operation chain transformation (not their corresponding transformations).

The issue is that in XLA, RemoveIdentityRemoving is a transformation that does not try to ensure only identity preserving operations are removed, but rather tries to identify a subset of operations that can be replaced with a more specialised or lower cost computational operation.

To ensure that the model left with an identity operation, I propose the following model: 

class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    return x1

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([2.,4.,6.,8.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)
```

Output can be compared directly using tf.reduce_all() function for equality.

Please run the models separately since equivalent outputs might not be obtained due to different random initialisation of relevant parameters in TensorFlow (TF) models.
