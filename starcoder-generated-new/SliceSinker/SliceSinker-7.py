# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]

# Call model

The model describes the slice-operation and the elementwise multiplication for the sake of demonstrating the desired model. The slice operations slice `x1` from index 1 to 3 and vice versa for `x2`
On running the model, it will create a reshape-like representation of the input as mentioned in the problem
