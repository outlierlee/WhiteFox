Class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.transpose(x1, [1, 0])
    return tf.tensordot(x1, x2, axes=1)

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [2,2]
x1 = tf.constant([[4.,5.],[6.,7.]], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)
```

# Explanation
This code creates a simple model where it first creates a transpose operation on input tensor x1, then performs a dot product operation with the transposed tensor. This is a scenario that the `TransposeFolding` pass in TensorFlow XLA would optimize. 

The output of the model should consist of a tensor like `[8. 10.]` which is the result of the transpose operation of the input tensor and the dot product operation performed with the transpose tensor.
