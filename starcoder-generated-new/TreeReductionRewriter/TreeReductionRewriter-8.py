Create a class that defines the model according to the TensorFlow API. Reduce the size of the tensor to a certain dimension.


```python
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self, reduce_window_size):
    super(Model, self).__init__()
    self.reduce_window_size = reduce_window_size

  def call(self, x1):
    x1 = tf.expand_dims(tf.expand_dims(x1, 0), 0)
    x2 = tf.nn.reduce_window_max(1, x1, [1, self.reduce_window_size, 1, 1], padding='VALID')
    return x2

# Initializing the model
m = Model(1)  # You can use any value here to make a new model

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [3, 1]
x1 = tf.ones(input_shape)  # You can use any tensor to make a new model

# Call model
y = m(x1)
```
This model dynamically constructs a sequence of reduction operations that can be handled by the `TreeReductionRewriter`, given the `reduce_window_size_` value. Please adjust the inputs appropriately to generate a valid TensorFlow model.
