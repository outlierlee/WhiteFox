class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self, reduce_window_size):
    super(Model, self).__init__()
    self.reduce_window_size = reduce_window_size

  def call(self, x1):
    return tf.reduce_sum(x1, axis=[0, 1])

# Initializing the model
m = Model(reduce_window_size_=4)

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4,4]
x1 = tf.constant([1.]*16, shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)
```
The shape of `x1` is [4,4], so the maximum dimension size that could trigger the optimization pass is 4. Therefore, `reduce_window_size_=4` is a valid value for initializing the model in the second example. If you try to use a smaller value, the model will not make the optimization pass trigger effectively.

Also, note that for the reshape patterns, I kept the reshape output the same shape as the input to avoid triggering the `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization, however, the `TreeReductionRewriter` can make use of these patterns as well, it's just not straightforward without tweaking the builtin passes.
