You can use TensorFlow and its APIs to create a model that contains such a pattern. Here is a simple example where the input tensor to the `tf.reduce_max` operation has two dimensions larger than the `reduce_window_size_`.

class Model(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    return tf.reduce_max(x1, axis=[0, 1])

m = Model()

input_shape = [100, 100, 100]
reduce_window_size = 10
x1 = tf.random.normal(input_shape)

output = m(x1)

Alternatively, below is an example of how you can create such a model. The first one has a dimension of size three larger than the `reduce_window_size_`. The second one has a dimension of size one larger than `reduce_window_size`.

```python
input_shape = [10, 100, 200]
x1 = tf.random.normal(input_shape)

output1 = tf.reduce_sum(x1, axis=[0,1])
output2 = tf.reduce_sum(x1, axis=[1,2])

print(output1, output2)
```

In the last line of code, the output shapes of the 2 `reduce_sum` can vary greatly depending on how the XLA optimizer and the input size distributions at runtime. The above pattern only specifies how we are forming the graph; an XLA runtime can do a more complex optimizations based on these rules that might include more target shapes.
