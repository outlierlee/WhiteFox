The model class `Model` should generate a TensorFlow model that has the pattern described. The pattern can be called by the method `call`. The inputs `x` to the `call` method should be random or static values. 

The output when you call the model `y = m(x)` should be the output after applying the pattern through the `call` method. In this model, the first reshape reshapes the tensor to `[2, 2]`, the second reshape reshapes it back to `[4]`, effectively preserving the original tensor.
This model can be used to trigger the optimization pass `SimplifyFpConversions` in TensorFlow XLA.
