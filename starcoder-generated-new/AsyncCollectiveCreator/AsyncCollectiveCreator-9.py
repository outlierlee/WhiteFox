```python
class Model(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()
    self.all_reduce = tf.raw_ops.AllReduce

  def call(self, x):
    ret = self.all_reduce(x)
    return ret
```
In this case, an `AllReduce` operation is embedded into the model, which can therefore be identified by the XLA optimization pass.

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [2]
x = tf.constant([1, 2], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x)
```
The code above initializes a model instance (`m`) with a single operation `AllReduce`. The `call` function returns the result of this operation, thus triggering the `AsyncCollectiveCreator` optimization pass when XLA compiles the model.

Note: Please note that XLA may not run on all platforms due to hardware support.
Make sure to configure TensorFlow XLA as mentioned in the TensorFlow documentation.
