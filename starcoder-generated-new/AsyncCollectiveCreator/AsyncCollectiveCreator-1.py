The Async version of collective ops are not supported out of the box by Tensorflow, so it first needs to be upgraded to a version with RPC or plug-in supported. For now, we are unable to create a model with `TensorFlow Version 2.8` or higher because it still doesn't support the Async versions of all collective ops. Nevertheless, the required upgrade can be done via pip:

```python
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
```
Now, this version of TensorFlow does support async collective ops and the corresponding optimization passes.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create RPC context to initialize the collective group
try:
    tf.experimental.rpc.Cluster.make_rpc_context("")
except AttributeError:
    print("RPC support is not available on this TensorFlow version. Please upgrade TensorFlow to use async collective operations.")
    exit(1)
   
class Model(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Model, self).__init__()

    def call(self, x):
        # AllReduce operation
        return tf.experimental.collectives.all_reduce(tf.reduce_sum(x), group=0)

# Initialize the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
x = tf.constant([1., 2., 3., 4.], shape=[4])

# Call model
y = m(x)
```
Meanwhile, if the use-case requires async versions of ops, this must be supported by the version of TensorFlow being used. If the TensorFlow version being used is upgraded, or the community makes an Async version of the Collective Ops available, this model can be updated to reflect that.
