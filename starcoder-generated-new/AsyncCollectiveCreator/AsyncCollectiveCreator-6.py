This description describes a complex model with multiple collective operations, such as the AllReduce, AllGather, and CollectivePermute. The specific modeling of these collective operations would depend on the targeted platforms and resources available for TensorFlow.
```
import tensorflow as tf

class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    global start
    global done
    x2 = tf.distribute.all_reduce_rows(x1, tf.distribute.ReduceOp.SUM)
    x3 = tf.distribute.all_gather(x2)
    x4 = tf.distribute.collective_permute(x3, tf.constant([2, 3, 0, 1]))
    output = tf.distribute.reduce_scatter(x4, [op.ReducerFn.SUM, op.ReducerFn.MIN], axis=0)
    return output

m = Model()
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([8.,7.,6.,5.], shape=input_shape)
y = m(x1)
```
Please note that the code provided above may not work intentionally. The required setup and configuration for collective operations in TensorFlow is not fully detailed in the code. Additionally, please make sure to compile your TensorFlow with XLA enabled for successful optimization pass.
