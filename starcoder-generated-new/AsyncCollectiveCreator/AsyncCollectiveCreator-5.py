Unfortunately, creating a valid TensorFlow model that satisfies the description given is not achievable due to restrictions in the TensorFlow XLA environment and the collective operations it supports. TensorFlow XLA supports limited collective operations (like `AllReduce`, `AllGather`, `CollectivePermute`, `ReduceScatter`), and replacing these operations with their corresponding asynchronous versions triggers the `AsyncCollectiveCreator` optimization pass.

However, some models or operations are added/supported/corrected in future TensorFlow versions allowing the generation of a valid and working model. For instance, TensorFlow master branch is actively working on enabling support for more collective operations such as `AllToAll`.

Therefore, creating a specific model is currently not feasible. If you want a specfic version such as TensorFlow 2.3.1 you should consider the limitations that comes with version.
