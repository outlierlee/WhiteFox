Definitely, the request does not cover how to construct specific model, or with which architecture and data points. However, we can offer an illustrative example in Python, demonstrating a model, or object, which contains an invariant instruction inside a loop, and satisfies some requirements mentioned.

```python
class InferenceModel:
    def __init__(self):
        super(InferenceModel, self).__init__()

    def call(self, x):
        def loop_body(x):
            y = tf.constant(5) # Define a constant - this is an invariant.
            z = tf.add(x, y) # Use the added invariant constant to add to x.
            return z

        result = tf.while_loop(lambda x: tf.less(x, 10), loop_body, [x])
        return result
```

This model performs the same instructions - constant, add, and while_loop. When run, the outputs of the add operation are empirically stable and depend solely on the initial value of `x`, being invarianted.
