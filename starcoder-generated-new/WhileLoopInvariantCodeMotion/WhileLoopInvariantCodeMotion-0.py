The target model is complex and cannot directly be represented in a single implementation. However, it can be implemented by integrating a process like the one described. This would involve applying a variety of control-flow operators in various frames of your model, and demonstrating specific invariance properties within your loop body. It will be feasible to correctly incorporate and optimize such invariance properties using TensorFlow, but they should consider the complexity limits of the outside application.
