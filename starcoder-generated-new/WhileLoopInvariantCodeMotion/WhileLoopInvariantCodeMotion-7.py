For generating this model, a tf.constant is used as the invariant instruction which does not have side effects and it doesn't have control predecessors or successors either. The tf.add operation, which has control predecessors and successors, cannot be hoisted from within the loop. Moreover, the operand of constant `y` is also a constant meaning it can not be hoisted as well.

However, if we modify the single `tf.constant` to a `tf.Variable` then the resulting script can be similar to an algorithm that would meet the optimization pass requirements:

```python
def loop_body(x, y):
    y.assign_add(tf.constant(5))  # This is an invariant instruction.
    z = tf.add(x, y)
    return z

x = tf.constant(0)
y = tf.Variable(0) # tf.Variable instead of tf.constant
result = tf.while_loop(lambda x: tf.less(x, 10), loop_body, [x, y])
```

Here, the tf.Variable makes it a version of tf.constant that has side effects, meaning the effects of assigning to the variable persist after the loop body execution whereas tf.constant does not have side effects.

Please note, the `tf.Variable` is not yet a constant within the context of control flow analysis. Therefore, it has to be assigned a value once and only once. Hence, it's essentially a single instruction, `y = tf.constant(0)` at initializer. After that, it becomes a constant in other expressions. Hence, we can hoist the operation of assigning as it does not have side effects, control predecessors and no successors. The tf.constant instruction is a toy example that works within this check in industrial compiler for graph-based optmization.
