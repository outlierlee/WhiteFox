The model provided uses the TensorFlow API `AllReduce` and `AllGather` which are used for distributed TensorFlow operations. However, please note that these particular APIs are being deprecated and instead it is recommended to use `tf.distribute.experimental.collectives.Send` and `tf.distribute.experimental.collectives.Receive`.

To use this model, you'd first need to set up a distribution strategy and initialize `x1` accordingly, ensuring it is compatible with your strategy. Please note that, for this model, XLA will not be able to trigger `CollectivesScheduleLinearizer` because the specific id selectors and combinators are hard-coded into the TensorFlow XLA compiler. Pull requests are welcome to address these limitations.
