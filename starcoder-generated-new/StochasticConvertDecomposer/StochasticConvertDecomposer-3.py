class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x):
    r = random_tensor([4])
    return tf.raw_ops.StochasticConvert(x, r)

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x = tf.constant([1.5, 2.2, 3.3, 4.7], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x)
```

In this case, `y` will be an integer tensor that's a stochastic conversion of `x`. Please note that "`random_tensor([4])`" is a placeholder function that should generate a tensor with random numbers according to its input shape. The specific implementation of `random_tensor` is not relevant to the problem at hand.

This model, when called with input tensor `x`, will trigger the `StochasticConvertDecomposer` optimization pass, but only if the target type of the conversion is a signed integral type, such as `tf.int32`, and not `tf.float32`. This is because for float to int conversion, usually TensorFlow would use `tf.cast` instead of `StochasticConvert`, which does not trigger the `StochasticConvertDecomposer` optimization.
