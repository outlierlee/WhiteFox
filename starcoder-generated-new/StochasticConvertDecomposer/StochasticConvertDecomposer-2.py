To generate a valid TensorFlow model for this scenario, a custom operation, say 'StochasticConvert', could be implemented. This custom operation would take 2 inputs, a Tensor of floating point numbers to convert and a Tensor of random numbers. The operation under the hood would implement the logic of the `StochasticConvert` operation and can then be used within a TensorFlow model to trigger the optimization pass.

To make the problem manageable and representable within a conceptual framework, here is an attempt to model this in a modular way:

```
    def StochasticConvert(input_tensor, random_tensor):
        
        # custom operation which implements stochastic conversion
        # ...

        # call the custom operation
        output_tensor = StochasticConvert(input_tensor, random_tensor)

        return output_tensor

    # simple model using the operation
    class Model(tf.keras.Model):

        def __init__(self):
            super(Model, self).__init__()

        def call(self, x):
            y = StochasticConvert(x[0], x[1])
            return y

    # create instances of the model
    m = Model()

    # generate data
    input_shape = [2, 3]
    x1 = tf.constant([[2., 1., 2.], [2., 1., 2.]] , shape=input_shape)
    x2 = tf.constant([[0.2, 0.1, 0.2], [0.2, 0.1, 0.2]] , shape=input_shape)

    # run the model
    y = m([x1, x2])

```

However, the TensorFlow disable this operation because it changes the exact shape or dtype of the input tensor (which is a semantics-preserving operation that converts a tensor from one type to another) and thus may violate the rules set by TensorFlow.
