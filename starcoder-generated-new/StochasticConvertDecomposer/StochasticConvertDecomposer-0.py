The target type of the stochastic_convert operation is guaranteed to be a signed integral type (such as `tf.int32` or `tf.int64`) because of the way we handle the stochastic rounding.

Here's a simple example of how you might use the `tf.raw_ops.StochasticConvert` operation to trigger the `StochasticConvertDecomposer` optimization:

```python
class SyntheticModel(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(SyntheticModel, self).__init__()

  def call(self, temp):
    output_tensor = tf.raw_ops.StochasticConvert(temp, temp)
    return output_tensor
```

# Test of model and output

```python
m = SyntheticModel()
temp = tf.constant([0.5,0.8,-0.9,1.2], shape=[4], dtype=tf.float32)
result = m(temp)
print(result)
```

In this model, `temp` is passed to the `call` function, which invokes the `tf.raw_ops.StochasticConvert` operation. This operation essentially tricks TensorFlow's numerical precision system to perform the operation with a stochastic rounding procedure. By requiring the stochastic conversion to be a case of `tf.int32`, we guarantee that this will trigger the `StochasticConvertDecomposer` optimization.
Please note that the stochastic output is dependent on the `tf.raw_ops.StochasticConvert` implementation and can only be verified empirically on the specific hardware/configuration running the script.
