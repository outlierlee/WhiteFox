Create a model with a single dot operation that matches the condition for being non-canonical. For example, you may have a model that performs element-wise multiplication between two tensors with different shapes.

While it's important to use tf.tensordot or tf.einsum for implementing dot operations as specified in TensorFlow's official guide, it's also possible to use the raw operator for explicit control over the dimensions. However, for practicality, it's often better to use tf.tensordot or tf.einsum to prevent errors and to obtain correct results.
