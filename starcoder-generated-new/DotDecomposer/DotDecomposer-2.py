The given model does not follow the requirement of the dot operation being non-canonical. Here is one way it can be implemented while not meeting the requirement:

```python
class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self):
    super(MyModel, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1, x2):
    return tf.tensordot(x1, x2, axes=1)
```

# Optimized Model
Here is how you can transform the original model into a non-canonical dot operation:

```python
class OptimizedModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self):
    super(OptimizedModel, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1, x2):
    # x1 has shape (batch_size, 6, 5, 4)
    # x2 has shape (batch_size, 2, 4, 3)
    # You can choose axes values for better tensorflow xla compilation
    return tf.tensordot(x1, x2, axes=[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]])
```
With this optimized model, the DotDecomposer will convert a non-canonical dot operation into a canonical one.
