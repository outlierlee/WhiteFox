class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, A, B, C, axis):
    x1 = tf.concat([A, B], axis)
    return tf.concat([x1, C], axis)

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
A = tf.random.uniform([4,4])
B = tf.random.uniform([4,4])
C = tf.random.uniform([4,4])
axis = 1

# Call model
y = m(A, B, C, axis)

Note: Please note that 2 is a random number that can change to adapt with your specific needs.

You can also adjust input dimensions and other specifications according to your needs. 

The tf_opt.run_xla_opt is great if you want to test the XLA pass, but you can use the tf_opt.dump_graphviz to capture the IR of the model graph in Graphviz format (Verified for TensorFlow 2.4.1). tf_opt.dump_graphviz is used in opt_benchmark.py of JAX repository. After you create the model, first load it to the tf_optimizer/tf_optimizer to dump the graphviz, and then load it again to the jax_transform.

Here's how you can use tf_opt to dump_graphviz:

From tf_opt git repo:

```python
# Include the repo into your python environment:
# You may need extra steps like `export PYTHONPATH=<path-to-tf_opt>` or using virtual environments.
from tf_opt import optimize_tf_model, utils
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

X = np.random.random((10, 10))  # Random input for testing.

model = keras.Sequential()
model.add(keras.layers.Dense(2))

# dump the graphviz of the model.
utils.dump_graphviz(optimize_tf_model(model))
``` 

This will dump a .dot file. You can open this file using a Graphviz software to see the IR.


Requirements:
- [tensorflow](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/) (for TensorFlow 2.4.1 we need to use tensorflow==2.4.1)
- [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) (if you want to visualize the graph after conversion to TensorFlow IR, necesssary for tf_opt).

Please note, to run TensorFlow JIT optimizations, TensorFlow CPU version 2.4.1 is required.
  
Run the jax tests with `ORT_DISABLE_ALL_OPTIMIZERS=1 pytest -v` in the jax repository before.

Examples may not be perfect and may not work on all possible configurations. Always make sure your model and XLA Configurations are compatible with them. These tests are just to show the concept and may have limitations. Please remember to modify these examples accordingly to suit your individual use cases.
