Here is an example model with dead computations and collectives:

```python
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x):
    y = tf.add(x, x)  # Duplicating the computation
    z = tf.multiply(x, x)  # Unnecessary computation

    # Collective operation using data fusion
    reduced = tf.raw_ops.CollectiveReduce(input=x, group="broadcast")
    dtype = temp_util.infer_variable_dtype_from_collision_dims(reduced, None)
    
    return tf.reshape(reduced, [2,2])
```

In this model, `y` and `z` are dead computations which will be removed by the `HloDCE` optimization pass. Additionally, the collective operation `CollectiveReduce` will be removed from the HLO graph as it doesn't have any side effects and has a constrained layout.
