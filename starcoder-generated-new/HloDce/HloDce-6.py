```python
class EntryPointModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self):
    super(EntryPointModel, self).__init__()
    
  def call(self, inputs):
    x = tf.constant([1.0])   # Some irrelevant computation
    # There is a dead computation, which is not accessible here.
    return x

model = EntryPointModel()

print(model.call(0))
```
The above model demonstrates a simple instance of a computation that is never called or used. Therefore, it can be safely and effectively removed by `HloDCE`. 

Note: Please explain what changes the optimization made and ensure that the code is maintainable and does not break without modification.
