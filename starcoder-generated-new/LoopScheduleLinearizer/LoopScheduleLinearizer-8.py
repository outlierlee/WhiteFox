Create a Python program defines a model associating the loop condition and loop body as follows, and run `xla_translate`.


```python
import tensorflow as tf

class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x):
    condition = lambda x, i: tf.reduce_sum(x) > 0
    def loop_body(x, i):
      read = tf.add(x, [1.])
      write = tf.assign(x, read)
      return write
    return tf.while_loop(condition, loop_body, [x, 0])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Call model
x = tf.constant([0.,0.,0.,0.], dtype=tf.float32)
y = m(x)
```

Although TensorFlow doesn't directly provide an API to create a loop structure with read and write operations on the same tensor, the model still gets optimized with `LoopScheduleLinearizer` because of the control flow involved, and the fact that the read operation occurs before the write operation.

However, please note, it utilized the tf.* ops in a very primitive format, creating the loop explicitly in the call method. Optimization passes in TensorFlow do not apply directly to functions in the way they apply with Keras models or directly applied XLA, they are a layer on top of Tensorflow that perform various tasks (like halting the graph to be executed, partitioning it for distributed execution, batching, other data dependent manipulations) in order to better fit into the integration paths that Tensorflow provides.
