The given model does not exactly trigger the `LoopScheduleLinearizer` optimization pass because `tf.some_operation(x)` is written to a variable `v1` using `tf.assign(v1, tf.some_operation(x))`, so a write operation happens before the read operation. However, we're not looking for a specific model at this point. We want to illustrate with a dummy model and you can replace it with your required model following the description above. 

# Creating an example model where read after write can happen

Here is an example of how you can get a similar output:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

v1 = tf.Variable([1,2,3,4])

@tf.function
def update_read(x):
    y = tf.assign(v1,x)
    return v1

@tf.function
def reads():
    # Read and write will be executed in the same step
    v1_updated = update_read([2,3,4,5])
    return v1_updated

print(reads())
```
Verifying which optimization pass triggers: To find out if the `LoopScheduleLinearizer` optimization pass is triggered, you can opt to print how the XLA JITed function looks by calling `print(reads.get_concrete_function().graph.as_graph_def())`. You can check if the `LoopScheduleLinearizer` pass is added in the outputted protobuf.

It's worth noting that the optimization pass is triggered as long as there's any forms of control dependencies across multiple iterations. In the example above, there is no control dependency on sequencing, but if you wanted to create a scenario with a control dependency, a write operation could also come from TensorFlow primitives. 

# Instructions
Please don't fill up the Model tag in your script with the actual model. TensorFlow XLA avoids applying this pass directly to the source model. It works with the lowered and optimized form of the graph. In case, you need help to optimize and manage TensorFlow model for XLA, feel free to reach out.
