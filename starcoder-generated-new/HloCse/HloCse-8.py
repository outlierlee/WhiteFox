Create a Python program defines a computation associating these instructions. You can design the computation, and the `HloCSE` optimization pass will choose to collapse identical instances of these instructions in the computation. 

An example:
```python
# Python TensorFlow code
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a computation
x = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = tf.constant([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])

# Identical instructions
z1 = tf.add(x, y)
z2 = tf.add(x, y)

# Identical constants
c1 = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
c2 = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Identical iota instructions
i1 = tf.raw_ops.Iota(dtype=tf.int32, iota_dimension=0, shape=[5])
i2 = tf.raw_ops.Iota(dtype=tf.int32, iota_dimension=0, shape=[5])

# Create a model with the computation
class Model(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, inputs):
    z3 = tf.add(inputs, inputs)
    return z1, z2, c1, c2, i1, i2, z3

# Create an instance of the model
m = Model()

# Call the model with an input tensor
input_shape = [5]
inputs = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], shape=input_shape)
output = m(inputs)
```
In the provided python code, we define an example input data (`x`, `y`, `i1`, `i2`, `c1`, `c2`), create identical instructions, and place them into a model. The optimizer should recognize these duplicates, while the `z3` instruction is placed into the call to create a subgraph with side effects that should be bypassed during the optimization.

The script should not crash TensorFlow or cause any other observable errors. This will be the most effective testing of your creation to ensure it progresses to the next stage and will serve as a solid foundation for further experimentation. 

The task ensures getting the model to trigger a specific XLA pass using various patterns that should make it harder to trigger in a larger model across various tensors. Limiting scope might also be necessary to allow the potential outputs to be manually checked without impacting other (distributed) computations. 

Here's a mock up TensorFlow project directory where this would be placed:

Example directory:
```bash
project_dir/
    model.py
    check.py
```

In `model.py`, this will import `tensorflow`, define the models and run it to generate the models, while `check.py` will compare these outputs and the XLA logs with a proper implementation of the merging process to validate the implementation of the XLA pass. It is highly recommended to design a test pattern because even a small error would bring the whole program down, and errors seem to be hard to find in a large and complex project, especially when there could be large number of possible outcomes.
