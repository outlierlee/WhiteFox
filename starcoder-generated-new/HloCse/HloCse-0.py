Creating the `HloCSE` compatible model is not possible only with public TensorFlow APIs as "HloCse" is not native TensorFlow optimizer. HloCse in XLA is an algorithm developed to apply common subexpression elimination to a module. However, at present Tensorflow XLA doesn't support this manually due to lack of libraries that can work as the same way as HloCse does in XLA. 

So, It is adviced to use libraries outside of Tensorflow which can directly integrate with concrete implementations of CSE operator. However this will be a project of its own under the guidance of Tensorflow team and should give one a full understanding of how XLA utilizes these libraries and what possible results they can provide.
