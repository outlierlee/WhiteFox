Create a class Model that inherits from tf.keras.Model. This class should have a call method that describes the reshape operations. This is a code representation in Python.

```python
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x):
    x1 = tf.reshape(x, [2, 2])
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, x.shape)
    return x2
```

This model is relatively simple as it only has a sequence of two tf.reshape operations which satisfy the condition in the description.

# Initializing the model
Here, we initialize an instance of our class `Model`.
```python
m = Model()
```

# Inputs to the model
We now design an input `x`. Here, the shape of the input tensor `x` is `[4]`.

```python
input_shape = [4]
x = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)
```

# Call model
Finally, we call our model with input tensor `x`.
```python
y = m(x)
```

The output `y` is expected to be the same as `x` after executing the code above. This is because the second `reshape` operation simply reshapes back the tensor from `[2, 2]` to `[4]`.
