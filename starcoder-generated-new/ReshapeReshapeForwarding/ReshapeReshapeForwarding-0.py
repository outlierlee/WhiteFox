The TensorFlow model involves building `Layer` classes using TensorFlow's public API. The model should contain a single `Layer`, where this `Layer` performs the required reshape operation in its `call()` function. 

```python
class ReshapeReshapeForwardingLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):

    def __init__(self):
        super(ReshapeReshapeForwardingLayer, self).__init__()

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Assume inputs.shape is [4]
        reshaped = tf.reshape(inputs, [2, 2])
        return tf.reshape(reshaped, [4])
```

The `ReshapeReshapeForwardingLayer()` in the code above should be able to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow's XLA capabilities.

Please note that the `call()` function signature of the `Layer` class can change based on the requirements of the reshapes. In this case, the `call()` function takes in a tensor as input and then reshapes it to a new shape compatible with the input shape, and then reshapes it back to the input shape. 

Finally, the `Model` class created below binds the `ReshapeReshapeForwardingLayer()` with an `Input()` representing the input tensor shape.

```python
input_shape = [4]
inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=input_shape)

layer = ReshapeReshapeForwardingLayer()
outputs = layer(inputs)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
```
