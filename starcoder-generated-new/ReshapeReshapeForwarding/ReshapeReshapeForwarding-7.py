Kindly provide the TensorFlow model for this class of requirements. It must only use public TensorFlow APIs.

# Model:
The model with the given requirements is as follows:

```python
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [4, 1])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([1.,2.,3.,4.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)

print(y) # Returns [1., 2., 3., 4.]
```

This model has a sequence of two reshape operations, where the output of the first reshape operation is reshaped back into the input shape of the second reshape operation. It uses the TensorFlow framework to carry out operations in a computation graph format, allowing the model to be trained and optimized.
