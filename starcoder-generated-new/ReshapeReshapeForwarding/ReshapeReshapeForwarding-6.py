Here is an example of a TensorFlow model that should meet this requirement:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define the sequence model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Model, self).__init__()

    def call(self, x):
        shape = tf.shape(x)
        x = tf.reshape(x, [-1, 2, 2])  # First reshape
        return tf.reshape(x, [shape[0], shape[1]*shape[2]])  # Second reshape to original size

# Initialize the model
model = Model() 

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = model(x)
```

In this model, the `Model` class is defined to include a call function which defines the two reshape operations as described. The reshapes are defined to be back to their original shapes which can result in the triggering of the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.
