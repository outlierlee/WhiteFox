The given model produces above-mentioned reshape patterns in TensorFlow:

```python
class ReshapeModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ReshapeModel, self).__init__()

    def call(self, x1):
        x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [4,1]) # new shape [4,1]
        return tf.reshape(x2, [4]) # back to original shape [4]

# initialize model
m = ReshapeModel()

# initial inputs
shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([1., 2., 3., 4.], shape=shape)

# calling model
y = m(x1)
```

This model can be used in TensorFlow to perform reshape operations and trigger the `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization.
