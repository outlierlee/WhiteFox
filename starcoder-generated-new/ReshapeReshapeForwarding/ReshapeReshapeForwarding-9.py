 Code

Here is a simple TensorFlow 2.X model with the described pattern:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class Model(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x):
    t1 = tf.reshape(x, [2, 2])
    t2 = tf.reshape(t1, [4])
    return t2

# Initialize the model
m = Model()

# Input tensor
x = tf.constant([[1., 2.], [3., 4.]])

# Call the model
y = m(x)
```

The `call` method of this model will produce a tensor `y` where `y = [1., 2., 3., 4.]`. This model uses the `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA because the output of the second `reshape()` operation, `y`, is the same as the original input tensor. Let's confirm that TensorFlow can use the ReshapeReshapeForwarding pass on this model.

We can also use TensorFlow's XLA (accelerated linear algebra) functionalities to compile the model,

```python
# Compile the model
compiled_model = tf.function(m)

# Call with Tracing (should trigger `ReshapeReshapeForwarding`)
y2 = compiled_model(x)
```

If you will compile this function and check the HLO has had `ReshapeReshapeForwarding`, then the compilation would be successful and you would get the output tensor. If not, then the compilation would have been unsuccessful and `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization would not have been performed.
