Creating the `WhileLoopExpensiveInvariantCodeMotion` model requires significantly more complex code due to the "unpredictable" nature of hoisted instructions. Code generation that closely resembles the above example is typically not feasible, as it is inherently risky due to the unpredictable nature and size of the constants.

Given the complication and risk, a clear minimum code snippet for the above model has yet to be developed. But, the same philosophical rule can be applied on the same line to generate a simple mirage of `WhileLoopExpensiveInvariantCodeMotion` model. However this will be less predictable and complex. Here is an example:

```python
def condition(x):
    return tf.reduce_sum(x) < 1000

def body(y):
    x = tf.constant(np.array([1, 2, 3])) 
    return x, tf.add(x, y)

x = tf.constant(np.array([1, 2, 3]))
state = x
result, _ =  tf.while_loop(condition, body, (state, tf.zeros([2])))
```

Again, the same rule applies here where out-put size of the instruction should not be significantly larger than its input and computational cost should be high enough to justify hoisting it out of the loop. Both of these rules, if followed, can potentially generate a valid mirage for this optimization.
