Here is an example of a TensorFlow model that should meet the requirements above:

```python
class Model(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Model, self).__init__()

    def call(self, x):
        y = tf.constant(np.array([1, 2, 3]))
        while tf.reduce_sum(x) < 1000:
           x = tf.add(x, y)
        return x
 
# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
x = tf.constant(np.array([1000, 1000, 1000]))

# Call model
y = m(x)
```

In this model, a while loop is present that checks if the sum of elements of a tensor `x` is less than 1000. Inside the loop, the same constant tensor `y` is added to `x` which is an invariant instruction. This results in an invariant code motion, where this instruction is hoisted out of the loop.
