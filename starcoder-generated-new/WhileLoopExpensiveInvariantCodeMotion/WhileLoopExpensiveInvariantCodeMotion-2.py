The given model does not exactly match the requirements but illustrates the concept. Below is an analogy of such a model:

```python
class Model(tf.Module):
  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  @tf.function(jit_compile=True)
  def call(self, x):
    x = tf.reshape(x, [2,2])
    x = tf.reshape(x, [-1, -1])
    x = tf.nn.leaky_relu(x)
    return x
```

This `Model` contains a single `@tf.function` that compiles into a callable object. This means the `call` function will be inlined into each tensor and future calls will be optimized based on the static shape of the tensors.
