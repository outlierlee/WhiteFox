```python
class Model(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x):
    y = tf.constant(np.array([1,2,3]))
    result = tf.while_loop(self.condition, self.body, [x])
    return result
  
  def condition(self, x):
    return tf.reduce_sum(x) < 1000

  def body(self, x):
    y = tf.constant(np.array([1,2,3]))
    z = tf.add(x, y)
    return z
```

However, in general, the XLA optimizer might choose not to apply `WhileLoopExpensiveInvariantCodeMotion` due to the additional complexity of the optimization and the potential adverse effects it could have on the model's performance and memory usage. Hence, for this specific requirement, it might be best to perform the exact mathematical operation inside the while loop instead of the invariant computation outside of it to achieve the optimized result.
