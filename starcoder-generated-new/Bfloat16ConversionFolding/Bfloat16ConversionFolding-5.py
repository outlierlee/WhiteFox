In this TensorFlow model, `tf.cast` is the only operation we use. TensorFlow's bfloat16 support is important because it enables users to train models in a mix of mixed-precision operations, meaning that certain parts of the graph (including input-output copies, reciprocal, mul, etc.) can be done in mixed precision.

This pattern will be successful only when optimization passes like `Bfloat16ConversionFolding` are triggered. Without the optimization, when this pattern is executed, it might not convert the tensors into `bfloat16` data type. This remains as it's not possible to simulate the execution of this kind of model in TensorFlow without XLA.
