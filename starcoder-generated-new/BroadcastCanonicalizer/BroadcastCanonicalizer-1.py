Keep in mind that not all the problem requirements can be met by TensorFlow. Some transformations require the operations to be run during execution time where TensorFlow operations are typically added at the graph construction phase and converted to a XLA operation by a XLA aware environment or converter. This makes the requirement of transformations which need to be run at the execution time restricting our scope here in solving this problem with TensorFlow Python API. 

PROMPTS GENERATED BY MODELLING TWO VQ-MODELS:
1. Please generate explainable, useful, and accessible AI models, for instance using reinforcement learning. Try to put some effort in making these models understandable.
2. Give me another model where a student attended and takes final exam that doesn't have other kinds of records. I can build a case-based reasoning system or logic-based reasoning system or behavior modeling system.
3. Given a valid image, predict the age of the person in the image. 
4. Summarize the paper or research about the topic you have given me.
5. Please generate text using GPT-3.
6. Build a system that could predict the Homecare simple tasks based on voice or body language.
7. Create a system that can check grave prediction based on provided evidence.
8. Implement the deterministic finite automaton that accepts the language of binary strings that end with 101.
9. Design an algorithm for the simple case of Huffman coding that can encode and decode binary strings.
10. Generate a model using deep learning to identify and classify image containing color changes in different structure at different luminosity.
