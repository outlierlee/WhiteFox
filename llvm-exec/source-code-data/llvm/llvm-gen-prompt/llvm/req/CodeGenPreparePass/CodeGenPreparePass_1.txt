The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Define a function with a switch statement
int switch_func(int x) {
  int result = 0; // declare the result
  switch (x) {
    case 1:
      result = x + 1;
      break;
    case 2:
      result = x + 2;
      break;
    default:
      result = x + 3;
      break;
  }
  return result;
}

int main() {
  int main_result = 0; // declare the result
  int x = 1; // initialize x with a constant value
  main_result = switch_func(x); // call the function with a constant argument
  printf("%d\n", main_result); // print the result
  return main_result; // return the result
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a call to `switch_func`, and the result of this call is being used. The `switch_func` contains a switch statement that branches based on the value of `x`. The key characteristic is that the argument passed to `switch_func` is a constant, which allows the switch statement to be optimized into a simpler control flow, such as an unconditional branch or a conditional branch with fewer cases. The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
