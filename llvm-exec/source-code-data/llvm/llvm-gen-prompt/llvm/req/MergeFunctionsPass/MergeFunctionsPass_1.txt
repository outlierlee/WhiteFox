The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Define two functions with identical bodies
int func1(int a, int b) {
    int result = a + b; // Perform some operation
    return result; // Return the result
}

int func2(int a, int b) {
    int result = a + b; // Perform the same operation as func1
    return result; // Return the result
}

int main() {
    int x = 5, y = 10; // Declare and initialize variables
    int result1 = func1(x, y); // Call the first function
    int result2 = func2(x, y); // Call the second function
    printf("Results: %d, %d\n", result1, result2); // Print the results
    return 0; // Return from main
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where there are two or more functions (`func1` and `func2`) with identical bodies, meaning they perform the same operations and return the same results given the same inputs. These functions should not have any external linkage or attributes that prevent merging. The `main` function calls these functions and uses their results, ensuring that the functions are not optimized away due to being unused. The presence of identical function bodies is the key characteristic that triggers the optimization.
