The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int sum = 0; // Initialize a variable to accumulate the sum
    int i; // Loop counter

    // A simple loop with a linear induction variable
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        sum += i; // Accumulate the sum of the loop counter
    }

    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum); // Print the result
    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where there is a loop with a simple induction variable, such as `i` in the `for` loop. The loop counter is incremented by a constant value (in this case, `1`), and the loop performs a straightforward operation, like accumulating a sum. The loop should be structured in a way that allows for potential strength reduction optimizations, such as replacing expensive operations with cheaper ones. The loop should be in a form that can be analyzed and transformed by the optimization pass, such as having a clear loop header and exit condition. The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
