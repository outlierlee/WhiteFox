The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  // Declare and initialize variables
  int x = ANY_VALUE; // x is used in the loop condition
  int y = ANY_VALUE; // y is used in the loop body

  // A loop that is provably never executed
  while (x < 0) { // The condition is always false
    // Loop body
    y = y OPERATOR ANY_VALUE; // Perform some operation on y
  }

  // Return a value related to the loop
  return y;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a loop with a condition that can be statically determined to be false, ensuring the loop body is never executed. The loop condition should involve a variable (e.g., `x`) that is initialized in such a way that the condition is always false (e.g., `x < 0` when `x` is initialized to a non-negative value). The loop body can contain any operations that do not affect the loop's execution, and the result of these operations should be returned or used in a way that is related to the loop. The `OPERATOR` could be any valid C operator, and `ANY_VALUE` should be a constant or expression that maintains the loop's non-executability.
