The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// declare variables
int a = ANY_VALUE; // declare a
int b = ANY_VALUE; // declare b
int c = ANY_VALUE; // declare c

int main() {
  int result = 0; // declare the result

  // perform a series of arithmetic operations
  result = (a + b) + c; // associative operation
  result = (result * a) * b; // another associative operation
  result = (result - c) - a; // yet another associative operation

  // use the result in a way that it is not trivially dead
  printf("%d\n", result);

  return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there are arithmetic operations that can be reassociated. The operations should be structured in a way that allows for reassociation, such as repeated addition, multiplication, or subtraction. The result of these operations should be used in a way that prevents the compiler from considering them trivially dead, such as by printing the result. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` should be initialized with any integer values. The operations should be simple enough to allow the compiler to identify opportunities for reassociation, which can lead to the removal of dead instructions and trigger the optimization.
