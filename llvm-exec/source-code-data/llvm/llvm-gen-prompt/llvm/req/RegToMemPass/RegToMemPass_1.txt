The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Define a function that uses local variables
void example_function() {
  // Declare multiple local variables
  int a = 10;
  float b = 20.5;
  char c = 'c';

  // Perform some operations using these variables
  a += 5;
  b *= 2.0;
  c = 'd';

  // Print the results
  printf("a: %d, b: %f, c: %c\n", a, b, c);
}

int main() {
  // Call the function
  example_function();

  return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within a function, multiple local variables are declared and initialized. These variables are then used in some operations, such as arithmetic or logical operations, and the results are used or printed. The function is called from the `main` function. The presence of multiple local variables and their usage in operations can lead to the generation of `alloca` instructions in the LLVM IR, which are necessary for the optimization to be triggered. The `main` function must call this function to ensure the code is executed.
