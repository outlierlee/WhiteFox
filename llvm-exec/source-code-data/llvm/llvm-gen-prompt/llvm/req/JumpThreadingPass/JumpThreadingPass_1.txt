The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Define a function with a simple conditional structure
int simple_conditional(int a, int b) {
    if (a > 0) {
        return b + 1;
    } else {
        return b - 1;
    }
}

int main() {
    int x = 5; // Initialize variable x
    int y = 10; // Initialize variable y
    int result = 0; // Declare result variable

    // Call the function with a constant condition
    result = simple_conditional(x, y);

    // Use the result in a conditional branch
    if (result > 10) {
        printf("Result is greater than 10\n");
    } else {
        printf("Result is 10 or less\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a call to a function like `simple_conditional`, which contains a simple conditional structure. The function is called with constant or predictable arguments, leading to a predictable outcome. The result of this function call is then used in a conditional branch in the `main` function. The program should have a structure that allows for potential simplification or removal of branches based on constant propagation or predictable control flow. The `main` function must return a value or perform an action that is influenced by the optimization for further comparison.
