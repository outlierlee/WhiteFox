The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Declare and initialize variables
    int a = 5;
    int b = 10;
    int c = 5; // Same value as 'a' to trigger common subexpression elimination

    // Perform operations that can be simplified
    int result1 = a + b; // First computation
    int result2 = c + b; // Second computation, same as result1

    // Use the results
    printf("Result1: %d\n", result1);
    printf("Result2: %d\n", result2);

    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there are multiple computations that produce the same result due to identical operations on identical operands. The program should include operations that can be simplified or eliminated by recognizing common subexpressions. The `main` function should perform operations that result in identical expressions, allowing the optimization to replace redundant computations with previously computed values. The program should use these results in a way that makes the optimization beneficial, such as printing or returning them.
