The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
// declare a static function that is never called
static int unused_function() {
  int result = 0; // declare a result variable
  RANDOM_CODE; // Do something here, but ensure the function is never called
  return result;
}

int main() {
  int main_result = 0; // declare the result
  // main function does not call unused_function
  RANDOM_CODE; // Do something here, but do not call unused_function
  return main_result; // return the result
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where there is a static function, `unused_function`, that is defined but never called within the program. The function should perform some operations, represented by `RANDOM_CODE`, but it should not be invoked anywhere in the `main` function or elsewhere in the program. The `main` function should execute some code, also represented by `RANDOM_CODE`, but it should not include a call to `unused_function`. The `RANDOM_CODE` can be any code that does not involve calling `unused_function`. The `main` function must return a value, but this value should not be related to `unused_function`. The presence of `unused_function` without any calls to it allows the optimization to identify it as dead code, triggering the optimization pass.
