The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10; // Declare and initialize a variable
    int b = 20; // Declare and initialize another variable
    int c; // Declare a variable to store the result

    if (a > 5) { // Conditional block
        c = a + b; // Perform an operation
    } else {
        c = a - b; // Perform a different operation
    }

    printf("%d\n", c); // Use the result

    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where:

1. **Conditional Blocks**: The program contains conditional blocks (e.g., `if-else` statements) that determine which operations are executed based on certain conditions.

2. **Variable Declarations and Initializations**: Variables are declared and initialized before the conditional blocks. These variables are used within the conditional blocks.

3. **Operations Inside Conditional Blocks**: Operations (e.g., arithmetic operations) are performed inside the conditional blocks, and the results are stored in variables.

4. **Use of Results**: The results of the operations are used after the conditional blocks, such as being printed or returned.

5. **Control Flow**: The control flow of the program allows for the possibility of moving instructions (e.g., the arithmetic operations) to a common successor block if the conditions are met.

The program should be structured in such a way that the operations inside the conditional blocks can be safely moved to a common successor block, which is a characteristic that can trigger the optimization process described.
