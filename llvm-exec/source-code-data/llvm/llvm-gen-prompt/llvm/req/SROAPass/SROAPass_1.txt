The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Define a struct with multiple fields
typedef struct {
    int a;
    float b;
    char c;
} MyStruct;

// Function that uses the struct
void useStruct(MyStruct *s) {
    // Perform operations on the struct fields
    s->a = 10;
    s->b = 20.5;
    s->c = 'z';
}

int main() {
    // Declare a struct variable
    MyStruct s;

    // Call the function that uses the struct
    useStruct(&s);

    // Print the struct fields
    printf("%d %f %c\n", s.a, s.b, s.c);

    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where a `struct` is defined with multiple fields of different types. The `main` function declares a variable of this `struct` type and passes it to a function that modifies its fields. The function `useStruct` performs operations on the struct fields, which can include assignments or other manipulations. The `main` function then prints the values of the struct fields. The struct is used in a way that allows the optimization to analyze and potentially eliminate dead instructions related to the struct's memory allocation and usage.
