The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <math.h>

int main() {
  // Declare and initialize floating-point variables
  float a = ANY_FLOAT_VALUE; // e.g., 1.5f
  float b = ANY_FLOAT_VALUE; // e.g., 2.5f
  float c = ANY_FLOAT_VALUE; // e.g., 3.5f

  // Perform a floating-point multiplication operation
  // that involves a constant and a variable
  float result = (a / b) * c; // This pattern can trigger the optimization

  // Return the result as an integer
  return (int)result;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a floating-point multiplication operation involving a division and a constant. The multiplication should be structured such that it can be reassociated or simplified by the optimization pass. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` should be initialized with any floating-point values. The result of the multiplication is returned as an integer to ensure the computation is used. The use of floating-point arithmetic and specific operations like division and multiplication are key to triggering the optimization.
