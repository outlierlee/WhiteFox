The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <string.h>

// Define a global constant variable
const char global_const[] = "Hello, World!";

// Define a function that uses memmove
void example_function(char *dest) {
    // Use memmove with the global constant as the source
    memmove(dest, global_const, sizeof(global_const));
}

int main() {
    char buffer[50]; // Declare a buffer
    example_function(buffer); // Call the function with the buffer
    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a call to `example_function`, which uses `memmove` with a global constant as the source. The global constant is defined as `const`, ensuring it is immutable. The `example_function` uses `memmove` to copy data from the global constant to a destination buffer. The `main` function initializes a buffer and passes it to `example_function`. The use of `memmove` with a constant global variable as the source is crucial, as it allows the optimization to replace `memmove` with `memcpy`, triggering the optimization pass.
