The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Define a function that contains a basic block structure
void example_function() {
    int a = 10; // Initialize a variable
    int b = 20; // Initialize another variable

    // Create a simple control flow with a conditional branch
    if (a < b) {
        a = a + 1; // Increment a
    } else {
        a = a - 1; // Decrement a
    }

    // Another conditional branch that can be optimized
    if (a < b) {
        a = a + 1; // Increment a again
    } else {
        a = a - 1; // Decrement a again
    }

    // Use the variable to prevent dead code elimination
    printf("%d\n", a);
}

int main() {
    example_function(); // Call the function
    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within a function, there are multiple basic blocks with conditional branches that can be merged. The function should have a simple control flow with conditional branches that can be optimized by merging blocks. The `example_function` contains two conditional branches with similar conditions and operations, which can be optimized by merging the blocks. The `main` function calls this function to ensure the code is executed. The program should avoid complex control flows or side effects that prevent block merging, such as exceptional terminators or side-effecting instructions. The use of variables and operations should be simple and straightforward to allow the optimization to identify and merge redundant blocks.
