The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i, j, k;
    int array1[10], array2[10], array3[10];

    // Initialize arrays
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        array1[i] = i;
        array2[i] = i * 2;
    }

    // First loop: perform some operations on array1
    for (j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
        array1[j] += 1;
    }

    // Second loop: perform some operations on array2
    for (k = 0; k < 10; k++) {
        array2[k] += 2;
    }

    // Use the results of the loops
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        array3[i] = array1[i] + array2[i];
    }

    // Print the results
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        printf("%d ", array3[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where there are multiple loops that iterate over the same range and perform independent operations on different arrays or data structures. The loops are simple and do not have complex control flow or dependencies between them. The loops should be adjacent or close to each other in the code, allowing for potential fusion. The `main` function initializes arrays, performs operations in separate loops, and then combines the results, which can be used to trigger the optimization. The loops should be structured in a way that they can be fused into a single loop without changing the program's semantics.
