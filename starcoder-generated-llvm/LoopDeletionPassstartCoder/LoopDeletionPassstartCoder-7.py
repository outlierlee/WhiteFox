```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  // Declare and initialize variables
  int x = -1;
  int y = 0;

  // A loop that is provably never executed
  while (x < 0) { // x is always negative because it has been initialized with a neagetive value -1
    // Loop body
    y = y + 1; // Perform some operation on y
  }

  // Return a value related to the loop
  return y;
}
```
