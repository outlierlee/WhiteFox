```c
#include <stdint.h>

int main() {
    int32_t x = 0b10000000000000000000000000000000; // 2147483648 as 32-bit integer
    int32_t y = 0b01111111111111111111111111111111; // 2147483647 as 32-bit integer
    int32_t result;
    
    result = (x << 12) >> 13; // Transforms and optimizes into (y << 7)

    return result;
}
```
The C code generated here is not equivalent to the previous C++ pattern. The first C program defines two integer constants `x` and `y`, performs the sequence of operations, and returns a value that can be used for comparison. The resulting C code has non-matching types, so it would not match the original C++ pattern and hence it cannot be used for further comparison. The C++ code pattern requires that these operations be applied respecting optimum formulations in the standard, facilitating best program execution times.
