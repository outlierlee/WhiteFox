```c
#include <stdio.h>

static int switch_func(int x) {
  int result = 0;
  switch (x) {
    case (1 << 31):
      result = x * 2 + 15;
      break;
    case (2 << 30):
      result = x + (1 << 30);
      break;
    default:
      result = x - (-1 << 30);
      break;
  }
  return result;
}

int main() {
  int main_result = 0;
  int x = (1 << 31);
  main_result = switch_func(x);
  printf("%d\n", main_result);
  return main_result;
}
```
The code includes a function named "switch_func" that includes a switch statement that determines the value of a integer type "x", in the case of x is a big value, add ( or subtract) some numbers to it to represent the change of compiler optimization, so optimize. The main function is tested under the x value as a big number that covers all cases of the switch function and then return the result to main function. It means in the main, you will find a optimized form for the optimization result. This code is encapsulated in the main function according to the pattern of optimization and returns value of optimization.
