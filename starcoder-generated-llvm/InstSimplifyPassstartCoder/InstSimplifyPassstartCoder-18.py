```cpp
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a = 8, i = 0, result = 0, b = 2;

  // run a redundant operation which can be optimized away (replication of a loop)
  for(i=0; i < 5; i++){
    result = a * 2;
    a = a * 2;
  }

  // perform a division operation which can be optimized to modulus
  if(b != 0){
    result = a / b; // this is equivalent to result = a % b; 
  } else {
    result = a / b; // handle division by zero
  }

  printf("Result: %d, Bynary shift: %d\n", result, a << 2);

  return 0;
}
```

The C++ code begins with same requirements for variable definition, division operation and redundant operation. In addition, the program performs a reduction operation (replication of a loop), which could be optimized, while division is optimized using modulus (and handles division by zero by trying to divide by zero). The program utilizes this optimization for invalidating results.
