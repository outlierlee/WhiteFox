```cpp
int main() {
    int x = 5, y = 8;
    while (x < y) {
        std::cout << "I am a loop" << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Hints

The above tasks are mainly about understanding of concepts and therefore there is no need to use any e.g., mathematical or computationally heavy approaches. To directly achieve tasks, one can use a simple `while` statement query since variables are not altered within the body and return a just abstract arithmetic result via `return 0;`. Being not so computationally heavy tasks require one to understand loop structures.
