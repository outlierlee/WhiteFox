```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int main() {
    int x = (1 << 7) + (1 << 6);  // x is a bit pattern 0101110.
    int y = 11;  // y is an odd number
    int z = 4;  // z is a even number

    // Here are the operations that do not affect the final result
    int a = x & y; // The bit-wise AND operation of x and y
    int b = y * z;  // Multiplication of y by z

    // The final result only depends on x and z
    int result = x & z;  // The result depends on x and z, and does not depend on other computations

    return result; // Result is a bit pattern and value related to the optimization
}
