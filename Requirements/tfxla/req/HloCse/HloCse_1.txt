The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `HloCSE` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

- The model contains instructions that are equivalent in terms of their operands and other attributes.
- Instructions are considered equivalent if they share the exact same set of operands.
- The model may have multiple instances of the same instruction with the same operands.
- The model may have instructions that can be combined to reduce redundancy and optimize computation.
- The model may contain constants or iota instructions that can be combined if they have the same type and value.
- The model may have instructions with zero operands (constants, parameters, etc.) that can be skipped over.
- The model may have instructions without side effects that are candidates for optimization.
- The model may have instructions that can be replaced with equivalent instructions to eliminate redundancy.
- The model may have instructions with commutative operands that need special handling for equivalence checking.

By exhibiting these characteristics, the `HloCSE` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA can identify and combine equivalent instructions in the model, leading to optimization and potentially reducing computation redundancy.
