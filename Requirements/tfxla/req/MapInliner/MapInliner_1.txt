The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `MapInliner` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

The model should contain a `map` operation where the function being applied is a single operation. The root instruction of the function should meet the following criteria:
- All operands of the root instruction are parameters.
- The root instruction is not a fusion operation.

Additionally, the root instruction can be one of the following:
- If the root is a parameter, the result of the computation is the corresponding operand.
- If the root is a constant, a broadcast may be needed to match the map shape.
- For other operations, the operands are cloned with new shape and operands.

If the model meets these criteria, the `changed_` flag is set to true, triggering the optimization pass `MapInliner` in TensorFlow XLA.
