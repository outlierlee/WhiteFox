The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `StochasticConvertDecomposer` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

The model should contain a `StochasticConvert` instruction with two operands: `operand` and `random`. The `StochasticConvert` instruction converts the `operand` tensor to a different type specified by `to_type` using a stochastic rounding method based on the `random` tensor.

The optimization pass is triggered when the `StochasticConvert` instruction is encountered in the model and meets the following conditions:
1. The `to_type` is a signed integral type.
2. The model performs specific operations on the `operand` tensor based on the stochastic rounding method, including:
   - Calculating the fractional part of the `operand`.
   - Comparing the fractional part with the `random` tensor.
   - Rounding the integer output based on the comparison results.
   - Handling minimum and maximum values for the output type.
3. The model does not convert to float types (support for converting to floats is not yet implemented).

If the TensorFlow model meets these conditions, the `DecomposeStochasticConvert` function will successfully decompose the `StochasticConvert` instruction, leading the function to return `OkStatus()`.
