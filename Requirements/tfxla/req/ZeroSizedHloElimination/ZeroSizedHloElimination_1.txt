The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `ZeroSizedHloElimination` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

The model should contain the following pattern:
- The model should not have any instructions with side effects.
- The model should not have instructions that are constants.
- The model should have instructions with array shapes.
- The model should have instructions with zero-element array shapes that are statically known.
- The model should allow safely removing instructions.
- If an instruction has a zero-element array shape and is safely removable, it will be replaced with a new constant instruction with the same shape.
- The replacement instruction will have a default layout if the original instruction doesn't have a layout.
- The optimization pass will return true if any changes were made during the elimination process.
