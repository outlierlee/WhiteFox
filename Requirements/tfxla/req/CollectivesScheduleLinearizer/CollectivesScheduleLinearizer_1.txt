The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `CollectivesScheduleLinearizer` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

The model should contain the following pattern:
- The model should have collective operations such as `AllReduce`, `AllGather`, `CollectivePermute`, or `Async` operations.
- The collective operations should be part of a computation within the module.
- The collective operations should have dependencies that need to be enforced for correct execution.
- The optimization pass aims to linearize the schedule of collective operations by adding control dependencies between them based on their relationships and dependencies.
- The linearization process ensures that the collective operations are executed in the correct order to maintain correctness and efficiency.

In summary, the optimization pass `CollectivesScheduleLinearizer` is triggered in a TensorFlow model that contains collective operations with dependencies that require enforcing control dependencies for proper scheduling and execution.
