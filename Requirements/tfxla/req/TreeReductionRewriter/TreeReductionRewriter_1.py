The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `TreeReductionRewriter` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

The model should contain a reduction operation where:
- The reduction operation is performed on an array-shaped input.
- The dimensions being reduced have sizes larger than a specified window size (`reduce_window_size`).
- The reduction operation is not variadic.
- The reduction operation involves creating a window with specific dimensions and strides based on the input shape and the window size.
- The reduction operation results in creating a new reduce window instruction and replacing the original reduction operation with the new instruction.

By satisfying these characteristics, the optimization pass `TreeReductionRewriter` can be triggered in TensorFlow XLA.
