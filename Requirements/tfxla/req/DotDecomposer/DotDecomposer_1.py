The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `DotDecomposer` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

- The model contains a dot operation (`HloOpcode::kDot`).
- The dot operation has only one contracting dimension in both left-hand side (lhs) and right-hand side (rhs).
- The dot operation has at most one non-contracting dimension in both lhs and rhs.
- If batch dimensions are present, they must be in a canonical form (consecutive integers starting from 0).
- The dot operation should not involve sparse inputs.

By satisfying these characteristics, the `DotDecomposer` optimization pass can be triggered in TensorFlow XLA, leading the function to return true at the `return changed;` line in the `DotDecomposer::Run` function.
