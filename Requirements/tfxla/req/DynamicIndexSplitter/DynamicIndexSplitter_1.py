The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `DynamicIndexSplitter` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

1. Contains dynamic slice (`kDynamicSlice`) or dynamic update slice (`kDynamicUpdateSlice`) operations.
2. The dynamic slice or dynamic update slice operation has a rank greater than 0.
3. The dynamic slice or dynamic update slice operation uses non-scalar indices.
4. The indices used in the dynamic slice or dynamic update slice operation are reshaped into scalar indices.

To trigger the `DynamicIndexSplitter` optimization pass, the model should have dynamic slice or dynamic update slice operations with non-scalar indices that need to be reshaped into scalar indices for further processing.
