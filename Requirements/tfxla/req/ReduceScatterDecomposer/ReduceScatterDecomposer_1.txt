The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `ReduceScatterDecomposer` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

The model should contain the following pattern:
- It should have a `HloReduceScatterInstruction` in the computation.
- The shape of the `HloReduceScatterInstruction` should be an array.
- It should create an all-reduce operation using the operands and parameters of the `HloReduceScatterInstruction`.
- It should create start indices for a dynamic slice to decompose the all-reduce results.
- It should replace all uses of the `HloReduceScatterInstruction` with the dynamic slice operation.
- It should remove the `HloReduceScatterInstruction` from the computation.

The presence of these characteristics in the TensorFlow model will trigger the `ReduceScatterDecomposer` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA, leading the function to return true.
