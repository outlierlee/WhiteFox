The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `AllReduceFolder` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

- The model contains two consecutive `AllReduce` operations.
- Both `AllReduce` operations have non-empty replica groups, listing all the participants exactly once.
- The replica groups of the two `AllReduce` operations are compatible except for the replica groups themselves.
- The output of the first `AllReduce` operation for each participant contributes to the result of the second `AllReduce` operation for that participant.
- The sets of contributors for each participant are compatible for forming a new `AllReduce`.

In summary, the model should exhibit a specific pattern of two consecutive `AllReduce` operations with compatible replica groups and contributions from the first operation to the second operation for each participant.
