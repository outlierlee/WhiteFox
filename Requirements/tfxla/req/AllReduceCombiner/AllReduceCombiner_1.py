The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `AllReduceCombiner` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

- The model contains multiple `AllReduce` operations with exactly one operand each.
- All the `AllReduce` operations have the same reduction operation.
- The operands of the `AllReduce` operations are combined into a single bigger `AllReduce` operation.
- The combined `AllReduce` operation is created with a tuple shape that includes the shapes of the individual operands.
- The sharding information is manually propagated to the combined `AllReduce` operation.
- The smaller `AllReduce` operations are replaced with elements of the tuple output of the single bigger `AllReduce` operation.

By satisfying these characteristics, the optimization pass `AllReduceCombiner` can be triggered in TensorFlow XLA.
