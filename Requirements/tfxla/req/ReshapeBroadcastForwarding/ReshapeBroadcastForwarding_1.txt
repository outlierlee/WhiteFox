The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeBroadcastForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.broadcast_to(input_tensor, [1])
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, [])
```

The pattern describes that there is a `broadcast_to` operation that broadcasts a tensor `input_tensor` to a higher rank, specifically to a rank of 1. Then, a `reshape` operation reshapes the output of the broadcast operation to a scalar tensor.
