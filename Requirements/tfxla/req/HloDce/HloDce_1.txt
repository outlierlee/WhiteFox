The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `HloDCE` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

- The model contains dead computations that are not referenced by any remaining instructions.
- The dead computations are identified by checking if they are not called by any instructions and have a live call count of 0.
- The dead computations are recursively removed by analyzing the computation's instructions and called sub-computations.
- The optimization pass aims to eliminate dead code by removing dead computations and their associated instructions.

In summary, the `HloDCE` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA is triggered by TensorFlow models that contain dead computations with no live callers, allowing for the removal of unnecessary computations and associated code.
