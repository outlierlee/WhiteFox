The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `DotMerger` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

- The model should contain multiple dot instructions (`HloOpcode::kDot`) where each dot instruction shares an operand with another dot instruction.
- The dot instructions should have the same layout and operand element types.
- The dot instructions should have matching dot dimension numbers (batch dimensions, contracting dimensions).
- The dot instructions should have matching operand precisions.
- The model should have dot instructions that are mergeable based on a specified maximum size to merge.
- The dot instructions should not have control dependencies.
- The dot instructions should be part of equivalence classes where at least two instructions are mergeable.
- The model should have a dependency graph representing the computation where dots can be merged within equivalence classes.
- The dot instructions should not have been merged before to avoid redundant merging attempts.
- The dot instructions should not be reachable from each other in the dependency graph to prevent cyclic dependencies.
- The dot instructions should be mergeable based on the specified maximum size and merge conditions.

By satisfying these characteristics, the `MergeDots` function can successfully merge the dot instructions in the TensorFlow model, leading to the optimization pass `DotMerger` returning `true` after merging the dots.
