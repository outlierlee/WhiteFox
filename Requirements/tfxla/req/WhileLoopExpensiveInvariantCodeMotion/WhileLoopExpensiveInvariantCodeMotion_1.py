The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `WhileLoopExpensiveInvariantCodeMotion` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

- The model should have a while loop structure.
- The while loop body should contain instructions that are invariant within the loop.
- The invariant instructions should not have side effects, control dependencies, or control successors.
- The shape of the while loop instruction should be a tuple.
- The model should not contain domain instructions or specific custom calls that are flagged as complex for hoisting.
- The invariant instructions should have transitive operands that are also invariant within the loop.
- The hoisted instructions should not cause a significant memory blow-up, especially if the output size is significantly larger than the input size.
- The hoisted instructions should be worth hoisting individually based on a specified criterion.
- The model should have a pattern where certain instructions can be hoisted out of the loop body to optimize performance.

By satisfying these characteristics, the optimization pass `WhileLoopExpensiveInvariantCodeMotion` can be triggered in TensorFlow XLA, leading to the function returning true and enabling the hoisting of invariant instructions from the while loop body.
