The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `BatchDotSimplification` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

1. The model should have a batch dot operation where the left-hand side (lhs) and right-hand side (rhs) batch dimensions are equal and strictly ascending.
2. The lhs and rhs batch dimensions should be equal to the sequence [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1] where n is the number of batch dimensions.
3. The model should have only one contracting dimension in the lhs.
4. There should be batch dimensions in the lhs with a size of 1, indicating degenerate dimensions.
5. The degenerate dimensions in the lhs should be identified and elided from the lhs and rhs operands.
6. The dot operation should be rewritten into a new dot operation with the degenerate dimensions removed.
7. The new dot operation should be reshaped to match the shape of the original batch dot operation.

Meeting these characteristics in the TensorFlow model will trigger the `BatchDotSimplification` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA.
