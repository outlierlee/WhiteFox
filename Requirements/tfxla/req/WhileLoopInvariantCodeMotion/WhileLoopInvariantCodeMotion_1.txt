The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `WhileLoopInvariantCodeMotion` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

- The model should contain loop structures, specifically `while` loops.
- The instructions within the loop body should not have side effects.
- The instructions should not be control flow instructions (e.g., `if`, `else`, `switch`).
- The instructions should not have control dependencies.
- The model should have loop-invariant instructions that can be hoisted out of the loop.
- Hoistable instructions include constants, reshapes, and certain other operations like bitcast, broadcast, iota, reverse, slice, transpose, and tuple.
- The hoisted instructions should not cause significant memory blow-up when moved outside the loop.
- The hoisted instructions should not be domain instructions or custom calls that complicate the hoisting process.
- The hoisted instructions should be worth hoisting, meaning they provide a benefit when moved outside the loop.
- The hoisting process should not violate any constraints specific to the model or the loop structure.

By satisfying these characteristics, the `WhileLoopInvariantCodeMotion` optimization pass can be triggered in TensorFlow XLA, leading to the hoisting of loop-invariant instructions and potentially improving the performance of the model.
