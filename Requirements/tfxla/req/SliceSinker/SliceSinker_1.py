The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `SliceSinker` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

1. The model contains multiple elementwise operations where each operation's operands are slices taken from the same indices of tensors with compatible shapes.
2. All the elementwise operations have the same opcode.
3. The corresponding operands of all operations are slices taken from the same bigger tensors.
4. The accumulated size of the group of operations is not less than the size of such a bigger tensor, ensuring that the transformation does not cause more elementwise operations to be performed.

The optimization pass `SliceSinker` aims to eliminate redundant work by merging elementwise operations when two slices overlap or are adjacent, leading to fewer kernel executions and more efficient computation.
