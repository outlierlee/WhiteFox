The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `WhileLoopTripCountAnnotator` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

The model should contain a while loop construct where the trip count of the loop can be statically determined at compile time. This means that the number of iterations the while loop will run is known before execution. The optimization pass annotates the while loop with this known trip count to enable further optimizations.

The pattern to trigger this optimization pass involves a while loop in the TensorFlow model where the trip count can be computed statically without any runtime dependencies or dynamic behavior. This allows the XLA compiler to optimize the loop based on the known trip count.

In summary, the model should have a while loop with a statically determinable trip count to trigger the `WhileLoopTripCountAnnotator` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA.
