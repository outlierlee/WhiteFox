The model should contain the following pattern:
```
concat1 = tf.concat([A, B], axis)
concat2 = tf.concat([concat1, C], axis)
```
The pattern describes that there are two concatenation operations in the model. The first `concat` operation concatenates tensors `A` and `B` along a specific axis, and the second `concat` operation concatenates the output of the first `concat` operation with tensor `C` along the same axis.
