The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `SortSimplifier` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

- The model contains a `sort` instruction with a tuple shape.
- The `sort` instruction is not the root instruction of the computation.
- The users of the `sort` instruction are `get-tuple-element` instructions.
- The `sort` instruction is used in a comparator computation.
- Some output values of the `sort` instruction are not used by any `get-tuple-element` instruction or the comparator computation.
- The unused output values are identified and removed from the `sort` instruction.
- The shape of the `sort` instruction is updated based on the remaining used operands.
- New parameters are created for the comparator computation based on the remaining used operands.
- The unused operands are removed, and the computation is updated accordingly.

These characteristics trigger the `SortSimplifier` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA.
