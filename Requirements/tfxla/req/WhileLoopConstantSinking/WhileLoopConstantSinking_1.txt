The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `WhileLoopConstantSinking` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

The model should have the following pattern:
- The model contains a while loop structure.
- The initial value of the while loop should be a tuple.
- The model has instructions in the while body that are loop invariant and can be replaced with constants.
- The loop invariant instructions should have at least one user that is not the root instruction of the while body.
- The loop invariant instructions should be constants or broadcasts of constants.
- The loop invariant instructions in the while body can be replaced with constants to sink them into the loop body.
- The loop invariant instructions in the while condition can also be replaced with constants if they have at least one user.

By satisfying these characteristics, the optimization pass `WhileLoopConstantSinking` can be triggered in TensorFlow XLA.
