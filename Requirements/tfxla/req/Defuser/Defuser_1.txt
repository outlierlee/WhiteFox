The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `Defuser` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

The model should contain a fusion instruction where multiple HLO instructions are fused together into a single computation. The fusion instruction should have the following pattern:

1. The fusion instruction should have a computation that fuses multiple HLO instructions.
2. The fusion instruction should have parameters that map to the operands of the fusion instruction.
3. The fusion instruction should replace all uses of the fusion expression root with the defused clone of the fused expression.
4. The fusion instruction should be defused by copying all instructions in the fusion instruction into the fusion instruction's parent computation and replacing the use of the fusion instruction with the copy of the fusion expression root.

When these characteristics are present in the TensorFlow model, the optimization pass `Defuser` in TensorFlow XLA will be triggered, leading the function `Defuser::Run` to return true after defusing the fusion instruction.
