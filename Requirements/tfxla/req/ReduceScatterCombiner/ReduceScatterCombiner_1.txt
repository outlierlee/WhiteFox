The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `ReduceScatterCombiner` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

The model should contain multiple `ReduceScatter` operations with the following constraints:
- Each `ReduceScatter` operation must have exactly one operand.
- All `ReduceScatter` operations must have the same reduction operation.
- The reduction operation must match for all `ReduceScatter` operations.
- The shapes of the operands of the `ReduceScatter` operations must be arrays.
- The scatter dimensions of the `ReduceScatter` operations must be the same.

The pattern to trigger the optimization pass involves combining the elements of the `ReduceScatter` operations into a single, larger `ReduceScatter` operation. The combined operation should have multiple operands, producing a tuple output. The operands of the combined operation are the operands of the smaller `ReduceScatter` operations. Finally, the smaller `ReduceScatter` operations are replaced with elements of the tuple output of the single larger `ReduceScatter` operation.

By satisfying these constraints and patterns in the TensorFlow model, the `ReduceScatterCombiner` optimization pass can be triggered, leading the function to return true.
