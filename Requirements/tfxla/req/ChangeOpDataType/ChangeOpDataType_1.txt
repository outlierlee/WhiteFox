The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `ChangeOpDataType` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

- The model should have instructions with uniform operand types, meaning all operands of an instruction have the same element type.
- The instruction should not be a parameter and should have an array shape.
- The model should contain an instruction that matches the specified operation matcher.
- For each eligible instruction, there should be a mapping from the current operand type to a target operand type in the `to_type_map_`.
- The optimization pass will change the data type of the operands of the instruction to the target type specified in the `to_type_map_`.

By satisfying these characteristics, the optimization pass `ChangeOpDataType` can be triggered in TensorFlow XLA.
