The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `TopkRewriter` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

1. The model contains a `HloSortInstruction` followed by potential slicing operations (`HloSliceInstruction`) on the sorted data.
2. The sort operation is part of a Top-K operation, where the top K elements are being extracted.
3. The sort operation is performed on a 1D or 2D tensor with element types `F32` or `BF16`.
4. The slicing operations are used to extract the top K elements along a specific dimension.
5. The model structure and operations align with the profitability check implemented in the `TransformToCustomCall` function of the `TopkRewriter`.
6. The model structure allows for the transformation of the sort operation into a custom call operation named "TopK" to optimize the computation.

By meeting these characteristics, the `TopkRewriter` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA can be triggered, leading to the function returning true and potentially optimizing the model.
