The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `ConvertMover` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

1. The model contains operations such as `Concatenate`, `Pad`, `Reshape`, `Slice`, or `Transpose`.
2. The model has a pattern where a `Convert` operation is applied to the operands of the mentioned operations.
3. The `Convert` operation is applied to operands that have the same source data type.
4. The source data type of the `Convert` operation is narrower (lower bit width) than the destination data type.
5. The model does not lose information when converting constants to a lower precision.
6. The `Convert` operation is the only user of its operand, or the operand is a constant.

By satisfying these characteristics, the optimization pass `ConvertMover` can be triggered in TensorFlow XLA, leading to the function `MoveConvertPrecisionOps` returning true.
