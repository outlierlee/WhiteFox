The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `BroadcastCanonicalizer` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

The model should contain the following pattern:
- The model should have a broadcast operation (`HloOpcode::kBroadcast`).
- The dimensions of the broadcast operation are not sorted in ascending order.
- The model reshapes the broadcast dimensions to be sorted in ascending order.
- The model then inserts a transpose operation to restore the original shape of the broadcast.

In summary, the optimization pass `BroadcastCanonicalizer` is triggered when the model contains a broadcast operation with unsorted dimensions, and the optimization pass reorders the dimensions and inserts a transpose operation to canonicalize the broadcast operation.
