The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `AsyncCollectiveCreator` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

1. The model contains collective operations such as AllReduce, AllGather, CollectivePermute, AllToAll, or ReduceScatter.
2. The configuration settings for each collective operation indicate that the operation should be converted to an asynchronous form.
3. The model structure includes the supported collective operations within a computation.
4. The model has a schedule defined, and the computation is scheduled within the module.
5. The collective operations are identified based on their opcode.
6. For each identified collective operation, a corresponding asynchronous pair of instructions (start and done) is created.
7. Control dependencies are updated for the asynchronous instructions.
8. The original collective operation instruction is replaced with the corresponding 'done' instruction.
9. The model may have control predecessors and successors for the collective operations.
10. The replacement of instructions and control dependencies leads to changes in the model, triggering the optimization pass.

By meeting these characteristics, the optimization pass `AsyncCollectiveCreator` in TensorFlow XLA can be triggered in the TensorFlow model.
