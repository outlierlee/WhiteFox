The characteristics of the TensorFlow model that trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA are as follows:

The model should contain a pattern where there are two consecutive reshape operations:
1. The first reshape operation reshapes a tensor `input_tensor` to a new shape.
2. The second reshape operation reshapes the output of the first reshape operation back to the original shape of `input_tensor`.

This pattern can be represented in code as:
```python
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```

When this pattern is present in the model, the `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization pass will be triggered, leading the function to return true.
