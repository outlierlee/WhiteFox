The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
t1 = linear(input_tensor)  # Apply a pointwise linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = t1 + other  # Add another tensor or scalar to the output of the linear transformation
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise linear transformation (such as a fully connected layer) is directly added to another tensor or scalar. The use of `mkldnn._linear_pointwise.default` suggests that the linear transformation is optimized for performance using MKL-DNN (oneDNN) libraries.
