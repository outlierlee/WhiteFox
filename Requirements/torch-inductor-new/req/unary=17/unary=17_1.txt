The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
t1 = conv_transpose(input_tensor) # Apply a transposed pointwise convolution to the input tensor
t2 = torch.relu(t1) # Apply the ReLU activation function to the output of the transposed convolution
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where a transposed pointwise convolution is applied to an input tensor, and the result is immediately passed through a ReLU activation function. The use of `mkldnn._convolution_transpose_pointwise.default` indicates that the convolution operation is optimized for MKL-DNN (oneDNN) backends, which is typically used for performance improvements on specific hardware.
