The model should contain the following pattern:
```python
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 + other # Add a tensor or scalar 'other' to the output of the convolution
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is directly added to another tensor or scalar, denoted as `other`. The convolution operation is performed using the `mkldnn._convolution_pointwise.default` function, which suggests the use of MKL-DNN optimizations for efficient computation.
