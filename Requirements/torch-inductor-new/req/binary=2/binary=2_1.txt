The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
t1 = conv(input_tensor)  # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 - other  # Subtract a specified value or tensor 'other' from the output of the convolution
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is directly subtracted by a specified value or tensor, denoted as `other`. The convolution operation is performed using a pointwise convolution, which typically involves a kernel size of 1.
