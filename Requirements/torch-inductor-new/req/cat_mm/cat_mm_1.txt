The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
# Assume inputs are matrices or 2D tensors
t1 = torch.mm(matrix1, matrix2)  # Perform matrix multiplication between two matrices
t2 = torch.mm(matrix3, matrix4)  # Perform matrix multiplication between another pair of matrices
# ...
# Additional matrix multiplications can be performed similarly
result = torch.cat([t1, t2, ...], dim)  # Concatenate the results of the matrix multiplications along a specified dimension
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where multiple matrix multiplications are performed, and the resulting matrices are concatenated along a specified dimension. The use of `aten.mm` indicates matrix multiplication operations, and `aten.cat` indicates the concatenation of the resulting matrices. The pattern is typical in models that require combining the results of several linear transformations or projections into a single tensor.
