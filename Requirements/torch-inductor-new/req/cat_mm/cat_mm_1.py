# Assume inputs are matrices or 2D tensors
t1 = torch.mm(matrix1, matrix2)  # Perform matrix multiplication between two matrices
t2 = torch.mm(matrix3, matrix4)  # Perform matrix multiplication between another pair of matrices
# ...
# Additional matrix multiplications can be performed similarly
result = torch.cat([t1, t2, ...], dim)  # Concatenate the results of the matrix multiplications along a specified dimension
