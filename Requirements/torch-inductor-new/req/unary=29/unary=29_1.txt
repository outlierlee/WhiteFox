The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
t1 = conv_transpose(input_tensor)  # Apply pointwise transposed convolution to the input tensor
t2 = torch.clamp_min(t1, min_value)  # Clamp the output of the transposed convolution to a minimum value
t3 = torch.clamp_max(t2, max_value)  # Clamp the result to a maximum value
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise transposed convolution is first clamped to a specified minimum value and then clamped to a specified maximum value. The use of `mkldnn._convolution_transpose_pointwise.default` indicates that the convolution operation is optimized for MKL-DNN (oneDNN) backends, which is typically used for performance improvements on specific hardware.
