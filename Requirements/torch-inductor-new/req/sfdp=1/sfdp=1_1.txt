The model should contain the following pattern, which is characteristic of a scaled dot-product attention mechanism, commonly used in transformer architectures:

```python
# Compute scaled dot-product attention
# Step 1: Compute the dot product of the query and the transposed key
attention_scores = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1))

# Step 2: Scale the attention scores by dividing by a scaling factor
scaled_attention_scores = attention_scores.div(inv_scale_factor)

# Step 3: Apply the softmax function to the scaled attention scores to obtain attention weights
attention_weights = scaled_attention_scores.softmax(dim=-1)

# Step 4: Apply dropout to the attention weights
attention_weights = torch.nn.functional.dropout(attention_weights, p=dropout_p)

# Step 5: Compute the final output by multiplying the attention weights with the value
output = attention_weights.matmul(value)
```

This pattern is indicative of the attention mechanism where the query, key, and value tensors are used to compute attention scores, which are then scaled, normalized, and used to weigh the value tensor, with optional dropout applied to the attention weights.
