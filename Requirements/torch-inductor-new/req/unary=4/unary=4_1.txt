The model should contain the following pattern:
```python
l1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply a linear transformation to the input tensor
l2 = l1 * 0.5 # Multiply the output of the linear transformation by 0.5
l3 = l1 * 0.7071067811865476 # Multiply the output of the linear transformation by 0.7071067811865476
l4 = torch.erf(l3) # Apply the error function to the scaled output of the linear transformation
l5 = l4 + 1 # Add 1 to the output of the error function
l6 = l2 * l5 # Multiply the scaled output of the linear transformation by the modified output of the error function
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a linear transformation is multiplied by a constant `0.5`, and then the output of the linear transformation is multiplied by another constant `0.7071067811865476`, and then the error function is applied to the scaled output of the linear transformation, and then `1` is added to the output of the error function, and finally, the scaled output of the linear transformation is multiplied by the modified output of the error function.
