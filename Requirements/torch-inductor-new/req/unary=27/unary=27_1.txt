The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
t1 = conv(input_tensor)  # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = torch.clamp_min(t1, min_value)  # Clamp the output of the convolution to have a minimum value of `min_value`
t3 = torch.clamp_max(t2, max_value)  # Clamp the result to have a maximum value of `max_value`
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is first clamped to ensure it does not fall below a specified minimum value (`min_value`), and then further clamped to ensure it does not exceed a specified maximum value (`max_value`).
