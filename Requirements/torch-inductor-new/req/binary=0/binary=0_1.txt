The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
t1 = conv(input_tensor)  # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 + other  # Add a tensor or scalar `other` to the output of the convolution
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is directly added to another tensor or scalar, denoted as `other`. The convolution operation is performed using the MKL-DNN backend, and the result is used in a simple addition operation.
