The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
t1 = linear(input_tensor)  # Apply a pointwise linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = t1 + other  # Add a tensor or scalar `other` to the output of the linear transformation
t3 = torch.relu(t2)  # Apply the ReLU activation function to the result
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where a pointwise linear transformation is applied to an input tensor, followed by an addition of another tensor or scalar, and then a ReLU activation function is applied to the result.
