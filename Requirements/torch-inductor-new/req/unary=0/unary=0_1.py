t1 = conv(input_tensor)  # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 * 0.5  # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.5

# Compute a complex expression involving multiple convolutions and multiplications
t3 = conv(input_tensor)  # Apply pointwise convolution again
t4 = conv(input_tensor)  # Apply pointwise convolution again
t5 = conv(input_tensor)  # Apply pointwise convolution again
t6 = conv(input_tensor)  # Apply pointwise convolution again

# Multiply the results of the convolutions
t7 = t3 * t4 * t5 * t6

# Multiply by a constant
t8 = t7 * 0.044715

# Add the result to another convolution
t9 = t3 + t8

# Multiply by another constant
t10 = t9 * 0.7978845608028654

# Apply the hyperbolic tangent function
t11 = torch.tanh(t10)

# Add 1 to the result
t12 = t11 + 1

# Multiply the initial scaled convolution result by the modified tanh result
t13 = t2 * t12
