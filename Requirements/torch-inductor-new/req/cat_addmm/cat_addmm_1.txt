The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
# Assume input_tensors is a list of input tensors, and dim is the dimension along which to concatenate
outputs = []
for input_tensor in input_tensors:
    # Perform a matrix multiplication and add the result to a bias term
    result = torch.addmm(bias, input_tensor, weight)
    outputs.append(result)

# Concatenate the results along a specified dimension
final_output = torch.cat(outputs, dim)
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where multiple input tensors undergo a matrix multiplication with a weight matrix, followed by the addition of a bias term. The results of these operations are then concatenated along a specified dimension. This is typically seen in models that require combining the outputs of several linear transformations, such as in certain types of feedforward neural networks or attention mechanisms.
