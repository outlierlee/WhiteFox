The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
# Concatenate tensors along dimension 1
cat_1 = torch.cat(tensors, dim=1)

# Slice the concatenated tensor along dimension 0
slice_1 = cat_1[:, 0:9223372036854775807]

# Slice the result along dimension 1 with a specified size
slice_2 = slice_1[:, 0:size]

# Concatenate the original concatenated tensor with the sliced tensor along dimension 1
result = torch.cat([cat_1, slice_2], dim=1)
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where a tensor is first concatenated along a specific dimension (dimension 1 in this case), then sliced along two dimensions (first dimension 0 with a large range, and then dimension 1 with a specified size), and finally concatenated again with the original concatenated tensor along the same dimension. This pattern is often used in models that require specific tensor manipulations involving concatenation and slicing operations.
