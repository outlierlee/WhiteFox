The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
t1 = linear(input_tensor)  # Apply a pointwise linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = t1 + other  # Add another tensor or scalar to the output of the linear transformation
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise linear transformation is added to another tensor or scalar. The linear transformation is applied using the `mkldnn._linear_pointwise.default` function, which suggests the use of MKL-DNN optimizations for efficient computation. The addition operation is performed using the `aten.add` function.
