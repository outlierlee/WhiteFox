The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
t1 = torch.mm(matrix1, matrix2)  # Perform matrix multiplication between two matrices
t2 = t1 + inp  # Add the result of the matrix multiplication to another input tensor
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where the result of a matrix multiplication operation (`torch.mm`) is added to another input tensor (`inp`). The addition is element-wise, and the dimensions of `t1` and `inp` must be compatible for broadcasting or direct addition.
