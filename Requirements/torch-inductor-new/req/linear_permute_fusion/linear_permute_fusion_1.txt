The model should contain the following pattern:
```python
t1 = torch.nn.functional.linear(input_tensor, ...) # Apply linear transformation to the input tensor.
t2 = t1.permute(...) # Permute the output of the linear transformation.
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the `torch.nn.functional.linear` function is invoked first, and then the tensor method 'permute' is invoked on the result of the linear transformation. The permute method is invoked on a tensor with more than 2 dimensions, and it swaps the last two dimensions of this tensor. This modified tensor is then used in subsequent operations.
