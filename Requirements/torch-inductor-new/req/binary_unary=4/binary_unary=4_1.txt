The model should contain the following pattern:
```python
t1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply a pointwise linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = t1 + other # Add a tensor or scalar 'other' to the output of the linear transformation
t3 = torch.relu(t2) # Apply the ReLU activation function to the result of the addition
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise linear transformation is added to another tensor or scalar, and then the ReLU activation function is applied to the result of this addition.
