The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
t1 = input_tensor.permute(...)  # Permute the input tensor
t2 = torch.nn.functional.linear(t1, ...)  # Apply linear transformation to the permuted tensor
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where:

1. The `permute` method is invoked on an input tensor with more than 2 dimensions.
2. The permutation swaps the last two dimensions of this tensor.
3. The permuted tensor is then used as the main input for the `torch.nn.functional.linear` function.

The `permute_linear_fusion` optimization will trigger the `module.graph.erase_node(node)` line when:

- The `linear` node is successfully replaced by a `transpose_linear` node.
- The original `linear` node is no longer needed and can be safely removed from the graph.
