The model should contain the following pattern:
```python
t1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply a linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = torch.sigmoid(t1) # Apply the sigmoid activation function to the output of the linear transformation
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a linear transformation (typically a fully connected layer) is passed through a sigmoid activation function. The use of `mkldnn._linear_pointwise.default` suggests that the linear transformation is optimized for performance using MKL-DNN (oneDNN) backend.
