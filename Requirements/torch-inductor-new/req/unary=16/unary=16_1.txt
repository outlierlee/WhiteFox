The model should contain the following pattern:
```python
t1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply a pointwise linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = torch.relu(t1) # Apply the ReLU activation function to the output of the linear transformation
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where a pointwise linear transformation is applied to an input tensor, followed by the application of the ReLU activation function to the result. This is a common pattern in neural networks where a linear layer is followed by a non-linear activation function to introduce non-linearity into the model.
