The model should contain the following pattern:
```python
t1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply a pointwise linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply the same pointwise linear transformation to the input tensor
t3 = torch.sigmoid(t2) # Apply the sigmoid activation function to the output of the linear transformation
t4 = t1 * t3 # Element-wise multiply the output of the first linear transformation by the sigmoid-activated output of the second linear transformation
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise linear transformation is element-wise multiplied by the sigmoid-activated output of the same linear transformation. This is often seen in models that implement gating mechanisms, such as those found in certain types of neural network architectures like LSTMs or GRUs, where the output is modulated by a gate.
