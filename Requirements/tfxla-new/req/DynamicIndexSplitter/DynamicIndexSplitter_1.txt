The model should contain the following pattern:

1. **Dynamic Slice or Dynamic Update Slice Operations**: The model must include either a `tf.raw_ops.DynamicSlice` or `tf.raw_ops.DynamicUpdateSlice` operation. These operations allow slicing or updating a tensor dynamically based on index values.

2. **Non-Scalar Index**: The index used for the `DynamicSlice` or `DynamicUpdateSlice` operation should be a non-scalar tensor. Specifically, the index tensor should have a rank of 1, meaning it is a vector rather than a single scalar value.

3. **Rank of Operand**: The operand (the tensor being sliced or updated) should have a rank greater than 0. This means the tensor is not a scalar, as the optimization specifically checks for non-zero rank to proceed with splitting the index.

4. **Index Splitting**: The index tensor should be such that it can be split into individual scalar indices for each dimension of the operand. This involves reshaping or slicing the index tensor into separate scalar values for each dimension of the operand.

Here is a simplified example pattern in TensorFlow code that could trigger this optimization:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume input_tensor is a tensor with rank > 0
input_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

# Non-scalar index tensor with rank 1
index_tensor = tf.constant([1, 0])

# Dynamic slice operation using a non-scalar index
sliced_tensor = tf.raw_ops.DynamicSlice(
    input=input_tensor,
    index=index_tensor,
    size=[1, 3]
)

# Alternatively, a dynamic update slice operation
update_tensor = tf.constant([[9, 9, 9]])
updated_tensor = tf.raw_ops.DynamicUpdateSlice(
    input=input_tensor,
    update=update_tensor,
    index=index_tensor
)
```

In this example, the `index_tensor` is a vector (rank 1), and the `input_tensor` has a rank greater than 0. This setup matches the conditions for the `DynamicIndexSplitter` optimization pass to be triggered.
