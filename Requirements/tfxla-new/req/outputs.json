The characteristics of the model that can trigger this optimization are as follows:\n\n1. **Consecutive AllReduce Operations**: The model must contain two `AllReduce` operations where the output of the first `AllReduce` is the input to the second `AllReduce`.\n\n2. **Single User Constraint**: The first `AllReduce` operation must have exactly one user, which is the second `AllReduce`.\n\n3. **Compatible AllReduce Operations**: The two `AllReduce` operations must be compatible in terms of their configurations, except for the replica groups. This means they should have the same shape, operands, and computation function, and they should not have layout constraints.\n\n4. **Non-Empty Replica Groups**: Both `AllReduce` operations must have non-empty replica groups, meaning they explicitly list all the participating replicas.\n\n5. **Foldable Replica Groups**: The replica groups of the two `AllReduce` operations must be such that they can be folded into a single set of replica groups. This involves ensuring that each replica's output in the second `AllReduce` can be traced back to a unique set of contributing replicas from the first `AllReduce`.\n\nHere is a simplified illustration of the pattern:\n\n```python\n# Assume x is a tensor and ar0 and ar1 are AllReduce operations\nar0 = tf.raw_ops.AllReduce(input=x, replica_groups=[[0, 1], [2, 3]])\nar1 = tf.raw_ops.AllReduce(input=ar0, replica_groups=[[0, 2], [1, 3]])\n```\n\nIn this example, the two `AllReduce` operations have compatible configurations and non-empty replica groups that can potentially be folded into a single set, thus triggering the `AllReduceFolder` optimization.",

Specifically, the model should contain computations or instructions that are not used in any meaningful way, allowing them to be safely removed without affecting the model's output. Here are the characteristics of a model that would trigger this optimization:\n\n1. **Dead Instructions**: The model contains instructions that are not used in any computation that contributes to the final output. These instructions do not have side effects or, if they do, the side effects are not relevant to the final output.\n\n2. **Removable While Loops**: The model includes `while` loops that are considered removable. This means the loop does not have side effects, or if it does, the side effects are not significant enough to prevent removal. Additionally, the loop does not contain any collective operations that constrain layout unless the `remove_cross_partition_collective_ops` flag is set to allow their removal.\n\n3. **Unused Computations**: The model has computations that are not called by any live instructions. These computations are not part of the execution path that leads to the final output and can be safely removed.\n\n4. **Nested Dead Computations**: The model may have nested computations that are dead because they are only called by other dead computations. These nested computations are also candidates for removal.\n\n5. **No Live Callers**: The model includes computations that have no live callers, meaning they are not referenced by any remaining instructions in the module.\n\nTo illustrate, consider a model with the following pattern:\n\n```python\ndef model(input_tensor):\n    # Some initial computations\n    x = tf.add(input_tensor, 1)\n    \n    # Dead computation\n    y = tf.multiply(x, 0)  # This result is never used\n    \n    # Removable while loop\n    def cond(x):\n        return tf.less(x, 10)\n    \n    def body(x):\n        return tf.add(x, 1)\n    \n    z = tf.while_loop(cond, body, [x])  # This loop does not affect the final output\n    \n    # Final output\n    return tf.add(x, 2)\n```\n\nIn this example, the multiplication by zero (`y`) and the while loop (`z`) are dead code because they do not contribute to the final output. The `HloDCE` pass would identify and remove these parts of the model, optimizing it by eliminating unnecessary computations.",

The characteristics of the model that can trigger this optimization are as follows:\n\n1. **Sort Operation with Tuple Output**: The model contains a `sort` operation that outputs a tuple. This means the `sort` operation is sorting multiple arrays simultaneously, and its output is a tuple containing sorted arrays.\n\n2. **Unused Tuple Elements**: Not all elements of the tuple output from the `sort` operation are used in subsequent computations. The optimization pass looks for tuple elements that are not accessed by any `get-tuple-element` operations or any other operations in the computation graph.\n\n3. **Comparator Usage**: The comparator function used in the `sort` operation may also influence the optimization. The pass checks which parameters of the comparator are actually used, and it considers these when determining which tuple elements are necessary.\n\n4. **Non-root Sort Instruction**: The `sort` operation should not be the root instruction of the computation. If it is the root, the optimization cannot proceed because it cannot analyze the users of the root instruction.\n\nHere is a simplified example pattern that could trigger the `SortSimplifier` optimization:\n\n```python\n# Assume `input_tensor` is a multi-dimensional tensor.\nsorted_tuple = tf.sort(input_tensor, axis=-1, direction='ASCENDING', output_type=tf.float32)\n\n# Only use some elements of the sorted tuple.\nused_element = tf.gather(sorted_tuple, indices=[0], axis=0)\n# Other elements of the tuple are not used in the computation.\n```\n\nIn this example, the `sort` operation produces a tuple, but only some elements of the tuple are used in subsequent operations.

This is typically done using a `Convert` operation.\n\n2. **All Users Conversion**: All users of the output of a particular operation should be `Convert` operations that convert from `F32` to `BF16`. This ensures that the output conversion can be folded.\n\n3. **BF16 Support**: The operations involved should support low precision (BF16) for both inputs and outputs. This is determined by the `bfloat16_support_` checks in the code.\n\n4. **No Mixed Precision Restriction**: If the operation does not support mixed precisions, then all operands and outputs must be convertible to `BF16` without leaving any in `F32`.\n\n5. **Exclusion of Certain Operations**: The model should not include operations that are excluded from conversion folding, such as tuples, constants, parameters, fusions, and control flow operations like `While` or `Conditional`.\n\n6. **Root Instruction Consideration**: If the operation is the root instruction of the computation, it should support mixed precision to allow operand conversion, as the root's output type cannot be changed.\n\nHere is a simplified example pattern that could trigger this optimization:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assume `some_operation` is an operation that supports BF16 and has F32 output\noutput = some_operation(input_tensor)\n\n# Convert the output from F32 to BF16\noutput_bf16 = tf.cast(output, dtype=tf.bfloat16)\n\n# All users of `output` should be using `output_bf16`\nresult = another_operation(output_bf16)\n```\n\nIn this pattern, `some_operation` produces an F32 output, which is then converted to BF16. If all users of the original F32 output are using the BF16 converted output, and the operation supports BF16, the `Bfloat16ConversionFolding` optimization can be triggered.",

These operations allow slicing or updating a tensor dynamically based on index values.\n\n2. **Non-Scalar Index**: The index used for the `DynamicSlice` or `DynamicUpdateSlice` operation should be a non-scalar tensor. Specifically, the index tensor should have a rank of 1, meaning it is a vector rather than a single scalar value.\n\n3. **Rank of Operand**: The operand (the tensor being sliced or updated) should have a rank greater than 0. This means the tensor is not a scalar, as the optimization specifically checks for non-zero rank to proceed with splitting the index.\n\n4. **Index Splitting**: The index tensor should be such that it can be split into individual scalar indices for each dimension of the operand. This involves reshaping or slicing the index tensor into separate scalar values for each dimension of the operand.\n\nHere is a simplified example pattern in TensorFlow code that could trigger this optimization:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assume input_tensor is a tensor with rank > 0\ninput_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n\n# Non-scalar index tensor with rank 1\nindex_tensor = tf.constant([1, 0])\n\n# Dynamic slice operation using a non-scalar index\nsliced_tensor = tf.raw_ops.DynamicSlice(\n    input=input_tensor,\n    index=index_tensor,\n    size=[1, 3]\n)\n\n# Alternatively, a dynamic update slice operation\nupdate_tensor = tf.constant([[9, 9, 9]])\nupdated_tensor = tf.raw_ops.DynamicUpdateSlice(\n    input=input_tensor,\n    update=update_tensor,\n    index=index_tensor\n)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `index_tensor` is a vector (rank 1), and the `input_tensor` has a rank greater than 0.

This implies that the reduction is not combining multiple tensors into a single output.\n\n4. **Reduction Function**: The reduction operation uses a specific reduction function, which is applied to the elements of the tensor along the specified dimensions.\n\nThe pattern can be illustrated with a code snippet:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Example tensor\ninput_tensor = tf.random.uniform(shape=[100, 200, 300])\n\n# Reduction operation with dimensions larger than reduce_window_size\n# Assume reduce_window_size is less than 100, 200, or 300\nreduced_tensor = tf.reduce_sum(input_tensor, axis=[0, 1])\n```\n\nIn this example, the reduction is performed along the first two dimensions of the `input_tensor`, and at least one of these dimensions must be larger than the `reduce_window_size` to trigger the optimization pass.",

The characteristics of the model that can trigger this optimization are as follows:\n\n1. **Elementwise Operations on Slices**: The model contains elementwise operations (e.g., addition, multiplication) where all operands are slices of larger tensors. These slices must be taken from the same indices of tensors with compatible shapes.\n\n2. **Same Slice Configuration**: The slices used as operands in these elementwise operations must have the same slice configuration, meaning they start, end, and stride at the same indices.\n\n3. **Similar Operations**: There are multiple elementwise operations with the same opcode and result element type, and their operands are slices from the same indices of the same larger tensors.\n\n4. **Sufficient Accumulated Size**: The accumulated size of the group of elementwise operations on slices must be at least as large as the size of the larger tensor from which the slices are taken. This ensures that the transformation does not increase the computational cost.\n\nHere is a code pattern that illustrates these characteristics:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assume input_tensor is a larger tensor\ninput_tensor = tf.constant([...], dtype=tf.float32)\n\n# Slices from the same indices\nslice1 = tf.slice(input_tensor, [start1], [size1])\nslice2 = tf.slice(input_tensor, [start2], [size2])\n\n# Elementwise operations on slices\nresult1 = tf.add(slice1, slice1)\nresult2 = tf.add(slice2, slice2)\n\n# The slices and operations meet the conditions for SliceSinker\n```\n\nIn this pattern, `slice1` and `slice2` are slices taken from `input_tensor` with the same start, size, and stride configurations.

These GTE operations in the condition function should have at least one user.\n\n6. **Broadcast of Constants**: If the model uses broadcasts of constants, the broadcast should originate from a constant value.\n\nThe pattern ensures that there are constants or broadcasts of constants in the loop's initial tuple that can be sunk into the loop body and condition, triggering the optimization pass."

These conditions are typically determined by the `should_decompose_` function, which might consider factors such as:\n   - The presence of specific attributes or configurations in the `AllGather` operation, such as `channel_id` or `use_global_device_ids`.\n   - The structure of `replica_groups`, which defines how devices are grouped for the operation.\n   - The dimension along which the `AllGather` is performed (`all_gather_dimension`).\n\n3. **Model Configuration**: The model should be configured in a way that the `AllGather` operation is not optimal or needs to be decomposed for better performance or compatibility with the target execution environment.\n\nIn summary, the model should include an `AllGather` operation that meets the criteria for decomposition as defined by the `should_decompose_` function, leading to the optimization pass being triggered."

The first operation is a `broadcast` that takes a scalar tensor `input_tensor` and broadcasts it to a tensor of shape `[1]`. The second operation is a `reshape` that takes the output of the `broadcast` and reshapes it back to a scalar (rank 0). \n\nKey characteristics:\n- The `input_tensor` must be a scalar (rank 0).\n- The `broadcast` operation increases the rank of `input_tensor` to 1.\n- The `reshape` operation reduces the rank of the broadcasted tensor back to 0.",
