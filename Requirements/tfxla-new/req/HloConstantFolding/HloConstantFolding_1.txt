The `HloConstantFolding` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA is triggered by models that contain operations where constant folding can be applied. The characteristics of such models include:

1. **Presence of Constants**: The model should have operations where at least one operand is a constant. This is a primary requirement for constant folding to be considered.

2. **Operands as Constants or Broadcasts of Constants**: All other operands of the operation should either be constants themselves or broadcasts of constants. This ensures that the operation can be evaluated at compile time.

3. **Exclusion of Certain Operations**: The model should not include operations that are explicitly excluded from constant folding, such as:
   - `kRng` and `kAfterAll` operations, which are not foldable due to side effects or other constraints.
   - `kParameter`, `kConstant`, and `kTuple` operations, which are not folded directly.
   - `kBroadcast` and `kIota` operations, which are avoided due to potential increases in constant size.
   - `kFft` operations, which are avoided due to potential compile-time increases.

4. **No Side Effects**: The operations should not have side effects or contain instructions with side effects, as these cannot be safely folded.

5. **Size Constraints**: The resulting constant from folding should not exceed a certain size threshold (e.g., 45 million elements), ensuring that the folding is beneficial and does not lead to excessive memory usage.

6. **No Asynchronous Execution Constraints**: The operations should not be part of an asynchronous execution thread that is not supposed to be changed by this pass.

7. **No Illegal Instructions**: The model should not contain or transitively contain instructions that are illegal for folding, such as those with side effects or those that are not supported by the evaluator.

By meeting these criteria, a model can trigger the `HloConstantFolding` optimization pass, leading to potential compile-time evaluation of operations and simplification of the computation graph.
