The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
output_tensor = tf.reshape(input_tensor, input_tensor.shape)
```

The pattern describes a single `reshape` operation where the input tensor `input_tensor` is reshaped to its original shape `input_tensor.shape`. This effectively means that the reshape operation does not change the shape of the tensor, making it an identity operation.
