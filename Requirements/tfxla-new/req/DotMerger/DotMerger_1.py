The `DotMerger` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA is triggered by a specific pattern in the model involving dot product operations. The characteristics of the model that can trigger this optimization are as follows:

1. **Presence of Dot Operations**: The model must contain at least two dot product operations (`dot0` and `dot1`).

2. **Shared Operand**: The two dot operations must share at least one operand. This means that either the left-hand side (LHS) or the right-hand side (RHS) operand of the dot operations must be the same.

3. **Matching Layouts**: The layouts of the dot operations must be identical. This includes the layout of the result and the layouts of the operands.

4. **Matching Element Types**: The element types of the operands and the result of the dot operations must match.

5. **Matching Dot Dimension Numbers**: The dot dimension numbers, including batch dimensions and contracting dimensions, must be the same for both dot operations.

6. **Matching Operand Precisions**: The precision configurations for the operands of the dot operations must be identical.

7. **Non-Dependency**: The dot operations must not have a transitive dependency on each other, meaning neither operation should depend on the result of the other.

8. **Mergeable Size**: At least one of the dot operations must be considered mergeable based on a size constraint (`max_size_to_merge`), which is determined by the byte size of the elements involved.

9. **No Control Dependencies**: The dot operations should not have any control dependencies.

The model should be structured such that these conditions are met, allowing the `DotMerger` optimization to merge the dot operations into a single operation with concatenated operands, followed by slicing to produce the original outputs. This can improve computational efficiency by reducing the number of separate dot operations.
