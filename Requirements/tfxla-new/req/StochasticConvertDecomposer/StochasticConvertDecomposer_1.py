The model should contain the following pattern:

1. **Stochastic Convert Operation**: The model must include a `stochastic_convert` operation. This operation is a specialized conversion that involves two operands:
   - **Operand 1**: The primary tensor to be converted. This tensor can be of any floating-point type (e.g., `F16`, `F32`).
   - **Operand 2**: A tensor representing random values, which is used to determine the stochastic rounding behavior. This tensor must have the same shape as Operand 1.

2. **Conversion to Signed Integer**: The `stochastic_convert` operation should be converting the floating-point tensor (Operand 1) to a signed integer type. The optimization specifically handles conversions where the target type is a signed integer.

3. **Shape and Type Compatibility**: The shapes of the operands and the result must be compatible as per the `ShapeInference::InferStochasticConvertShape` function. This ensures that the conversion operation is valid and can be decomposed.

4. **Random Value Normalization**: The random values (Operand 2) are used to determine whether the fractional part of the floating-point number should be rounded up or down. The model should ensure that these random values are appropriately normalized for comparison.

By including these characteristics, the model will trigger the `StochasticConvertDecomposer` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA, leading the function to return `OkStatus()`.
