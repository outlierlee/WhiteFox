The `TopkRewriter` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA is triggered by a specific pattern in the model involving a sorting operation that resembles a Top-K operation. The characteristics of the model that trigger this optimization include:

1. **Sort Operation**: The model must contain a sort operation (`HloSortInstruction`) that is potentially part of a Top-K computation.

2. **Operand Count**: The sort operation should have either one or two operands. If it has two operands, the second operand must be an iota (a sequence of increasing integers).

3. **Comparison Function**: The sort operation must use a comparison function that is "NaN-safe" and matches specific patterns, such as bitcasting and comparing floating-point numbers (F32 or BF16) or integers (S32).

4. **Slice Operation**: The users of the sort operation must include slice operations that extract the top K elements. The slice must start at zero and have a stride of one, and it should not slice along the batch dimension if present.

5. **Data Shape and Type**: The data being sorted should have a rank of either 1 or 2, and the element type should be either F32 or BF16.

6. **Batch Dimension**: If the data has a rank of 2, it is considered to have a batch dimension. The sort dimension should be either 0 or 1, and the batch dimension should be the opposite.

7. **Profitability Check**: The transformation is only applied if it is deemed profitable, which is determined by a separate check not detailed in the provided code.

The model should follow these patterns to trigger the `TopkRewriter` optimization pass, leading to the transformation of the sort operation into a more efficient custom call for Top-K computation.
