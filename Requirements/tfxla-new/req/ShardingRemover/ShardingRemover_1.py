The model should contain the following pattern:

The model includes a custom call operation that is specifically related to sharding. This operation must be one of the following:

- `"Sharding"`
- `"SPMDShardToFullShape"`
- `"SPMDFullToShardShape"`

These operations are typically used to manage data distribution across multiple devices in a distributed setting. The custom call operation must have exactly one operand, which is a requirement for the optimization pass to be triggered. The presence of any of these custom call operations in the model will lead to the `ShardingRemover` optimization pass being activated, as it will attempt to remove these operations by replacing their uses with their single operand.
