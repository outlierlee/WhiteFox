The TensorFlow model that triggers the `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA should exhibit the following characteristics:

1. **Two Consecutive Reshape Operations**: The model must contain two consecutive `reshape` operations applied to a tensor.

2. **Initial Reshape**: The first `reshape` operation transforms an input tensor `A` from its original shape to a new shape. This new shape can be any valid shape that is compatible with the number of elements in `A`.

   ```python
   t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, new_shape)
   ```

3. **Reverting Reshape**: The second `reshape` operation takes the output of the first reshape (`t1`) and reshapes it back to the original shape of `input_tensor`.

   ```python
   t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
   ```

4. **Shape Equality**: The shape of the tensor after the second reshape (`t2`) must be equal to the original shape of `input_tensor`. This ensures that the two reshapes effectively cancel each other out, leaving the tensor in its original shape.

By following this pattern, the model will trigger the `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` optimization, as the two reshapes can be effectively removed, simplifying the computation graph.
