The `Defuser` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA is triggered by the presence of fusion computations within a model. Specifically, the characteristics of the model that would trigger this optimization include:

1. **Fusion Computation**: The model must contain a fusion computation. A fusion computation is a subgraph of operations that have been combined into a single operation for optimization purposes. This is typically done to improve performance by reducing memory bandwidth usage and increasing data locality.

2. **Single Caller**: The fusion computation must be called by exactly one instruction in the parent computation. This means that the fusion computation is not shared among multiple call sites, which allows it to be defused back into the parent computation without affecting other parts of the model.

3. **Presence of Fused Instructions**: The fusion computation should contain multiple instructions that have been fused together. These instructions are typically simple element-wise operations or other operations that can be efficiently combined.

4. **Defusable Pattern**: The pattern of operations within the fusion computation should be such that they can be defused, meaning they can be separated back into individual operations in the parent computation without violating any constraints or dependencies.

In summary, the model should contain a fusion computation with a single caller, and the operations within the fusion should be suitable for defusion back into the parent computation. This pattern will trigger the `Defuser` optimization pass, leading to the defusion of the fused operations.
