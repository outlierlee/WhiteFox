The model should contain the following pattern:

1. **AllGather Operation**: The model includes an `AllGather` operation, which is a collective communication operation used in distributed training to gather tensors from multiple devices.

2. **Decomposition Condition**: The `AllGather` operation should meet specific conditions that trigger its decomposition. These conditions are typically determined by the `should_decompose_` function, which might consider factors such as:
   - The presence of specific attributes or configurations in the `AllGather` operation, such as `channel_id` or `use_global_device_ids`.
   - The structure of `replica_groups`, which defines how devices are grouped for the operation.
   - The dimension along which the `AllGather` is performed (`all_gather_dimension`).

3. **Model Configuration**: The model should be configured in a way that the `AllGather` operation is not optimal or needs to be decomposed for better performance or compatibility with the target execution environment.

In summary, the model should include an `AllGather` operation that meets the criteria for decomposition as defined by the `should_decompose_` function, leading to the optimization pass being triggered.
