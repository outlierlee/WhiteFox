The model should contain the following pattern:

1. **Reduce-Scatter Operations**: The model must include two `ReduceScatter` operations that are directly connected to another operation by a data flow edge. These operations should be compatible with each other, meaning they share the same `AllReduceKey`, have the same scatter dimension, and apply the same reduction computation.

2. **Reduction Operation**: There should be a reduction operation that takes the outputs of the two `ReduceScatter` operations as its inputs. This reduction operation must match a specific `ReductionKind` that is compatible with the `ReduceScatter` operations.

3. **Single User Constraint**: Each of the `ReduceScatter` operations should have exactly one user, which is the reduction operation mentioned above.

4. **Array Shape**: The shape of the reduction operation's output must be an array.

The pattern can be illustrated as follows in pseudo-code:

```python
# Assume rs0 and rs1 are ReduceScatter operations
# that are compatible with each other.
rs0 = tf.reduce_scatter(input_tensor_0, ...)
rs1 = tf.reduce_scatter(input_tensor_1, ...)

# A reduction operation that takes the outputs of rs0 and rs1.
output = reduction_op(rs0, rs1)
```

This pattern ensures that the `ReduceScatterReassociate` optimization pass can be triggered, leading to the transformation of the pattern into a more efficient form.
