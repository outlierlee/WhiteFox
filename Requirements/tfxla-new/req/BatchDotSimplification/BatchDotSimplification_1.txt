The model should contain the following pattern:

1. **Batch Dot Product**: The model includes a batch dot product operation where the batch dimensions of the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) tensors are equal and strictly ascending. This means that the batch dimensions are in the order `[0, 1, 2, ...]`.

2. **Degenerate Batch Dimensions**: At least one of the batch dimensions in the LHS tensor has a size of 1. These are referred to as degenerate dimensions.

3. **Single Contracting Dimension**: The dot operation has exactly one contracting dimension. This means that the dot product is performed over a single dimension from each of the LHS and RHS tensors.

The pattern can be illustrated with the following pseudo-code:

```python
# Assume lhs and rhs are tensors with shapes that include batch dimensions.
# The batch dimensions are equal and strictly ascending, e.g., [0, 1, 2, ...].
# At least one of these batch dimensions has size 1 in the lhs tensor.

lhs = tf.constant(..., shape=[1, ..., M, K])  # Example shape with a degenerate batch dimension
rhs = tf.constant(..., shape=[1, ..., K, N])  # Corresponding shape for rhs

# Perform a batch dot product with a single contracting dimension.
result = tf.linalg.matmul(lhs, rhs, ...)
```

This pattern ensures that the optimization pass `BatchDotSimplification` is triggered, as it identifies opportunities to simplify the batch dot operation by removing degenerate batch dimensions.
