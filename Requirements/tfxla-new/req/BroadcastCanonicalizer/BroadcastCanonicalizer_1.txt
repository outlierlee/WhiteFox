The model should contain the following pattern:

1. **Broadcast Operation**: The model includes a broadcast operation where the dimensions being broadcasted are not in sorted order. This means that the dimensions specified for the broadcast are not in ascending order, which is a key characteristic that triggers the optimization pass.

2. **Example Pattern**:
   ```python
   import tensorflow as tf

   # Assume `input_tensor` is a tensor with shape [a, b, c]
   input_tensor = tf.constant(...)

   # Broadcasting `input_tensor` to a higher-dimensional shape with unsorted dimensions
   # For example, broadcasting to shape [1, a, 1, b, c] with broadcast dimensions [1, 3, 4]
   broadcasted_tensor = tf.broadcast_to(input_tensor, [1, a, 1, b, c])
   ```

3. **Unsorted Broadcast Dimensions**: The broadcast dimensions in the operation are not sorted, which means they do not follow a natural increasing order. This unsorted nature of the broadcast dimensions is what the `BroadcastCanonicalizer` optimization pass looks to address.

By ensuring that the model contains a broadcast operation with unsorted dimensions, the `BroadcastCanonicalizer` pass will be triggered, leading to the `return changed;` line being reached and the function returning true.
