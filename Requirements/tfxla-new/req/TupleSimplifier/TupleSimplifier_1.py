The model should contain the following pattern:

1. **Tuple and GetTupleElement (GTE) Pattern**: The model should have a `Tuple` operation that is immediately followed by a series of `GetTupleElement` operations. Each `GetTupleElement` operation should extract elements from the `Tuple` in the same order they were inserted. This means that for a `Tuple` operation with `n` elements, there should be `n` corresponding `GetTupleElement` operations, each accessing the tuple element at its respective index.

2. **Consistent Operand Source**: All `GetTupleElement` operations should reference the same `Tuple` operation, and the `Tuple` operation should have operands that are directly compatible with the shape of the `Tuple`.

3. **No Intermediate Operations**: There should be no intermediate operations between the `Tuple` and the `GetTupleElement` operations that would alter the tuple structure or the order of elements.

4. **Shape Compatibility**: The shape of the `Tuple` operation should be compatible with the shape of the `GetTupleElement` operations, ensuring that the elements extracted match the expected shapes.

5. **Non-Entry Computation**: If the `TupleSimplifier` is configured to exclude the entry computation, the pattern should not be in the entry computation of the module.

This pattern allows the `TupleSimplifier` to identify and remove the `Tuple` operation, replacing the `GetTupleElement` operations with their respective source operands, thus simplifying the computation graph.
