The model should contain the following characteristics to trigger the `ChangeOpDataType` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA:

1. **Uniform Operand Types**: The operation in the model should have operands that all share the same data type. This is determined by the `GetUniformOperandType` function, which checks if all operands of an instruction have the same `element_type`.

2. **Array Shape**: The operation's output shape must be an array. This is checked by the condition `instr->shape().IsArray()`.

3. **Non-Parameter Operation**: The operation should not be a parameter operation, as indicated by the condition `instr->opcode() != HloOpcode::kParameter`.

4. **Matching Operation**: The operation must match a specific pattern or condition defined by `op_matcher_`. This is a customizable condition that determines which operations are eligible for data type change.

5. **Type Conversion Mapping**: There must be a mapping from the current operand type (`from_type`) to a new type (`to_type`) in the `to_type_map_`. This mapping is used to determine the target data type for conversion.

The model should include operations that meet these criteria, allowing the `ChangeOpDataType` pass to identify and convert the data types of the operations' operands and outputs according to the specified mapping.
