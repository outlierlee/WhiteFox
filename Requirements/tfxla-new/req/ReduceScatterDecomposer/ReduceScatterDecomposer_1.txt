The model should contain the following pattern:

1. **ReduceScatter Operation**: The model must include a `ReduceScatter` operation. This operation is a collective communication operation that reduces data across multiple devices and scatters the result across those devices.

2. **Array Shape**: The `ReduceScatter` operation must have an output shape that is an array. This means the result of the `ReduceScatter` operation should be a tensor with a defined array shape.

3. **Channel ID**: The `ReduceScatter` operation may optionally have a channel ID. If a channel ID is present, it is used to uniquely identify the communication channel for the operation.

4. **Replica Groups**: The `ReduceScatter` operation should define replica groups, which specify how devices are grouped for the collective operation.

5. **Use of Global Device IDs**: The `ReduceScatter` operation may use global device IDs, which affects how devices are identified and grouped for the operation.

The presence of these characteristics in a TensorFlow model will trigger the `ReduceScatterDecomposer` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA, leading the function to return `true`.
