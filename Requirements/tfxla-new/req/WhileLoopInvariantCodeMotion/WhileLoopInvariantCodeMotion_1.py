The `WhileLoopInvariantCodeMotion` optimization pass in TensorFlow XLA is triggered by models that contain while loops with invariant computations inside the loop body. The characteristics of such models include:

1. **While Loop Structure**: The model must contain a while loop, which is represented by a `tf.while_loop` or similar construct in TensorFlow.

2. **Invariant Computations**: Within the body of the while loop, there are computations that do not depend on the loop's iteration variable(s) and produce the same result in every iteration. These computations are candidates for hoisting outside the loop.

3. **Tuple State**: The state passed through the while loop must be a tuple. This is a requirement for the optimization to consider hoisting invariant computations.

4. **No Side Effects**: The computations to be hoisted must not have side effects, such as modifying global state or performing I/O operations.

5. **No Control Dependencies**: The computations should not have control dependencies, meaning they should not be part of a control flow that affects other operations.

6. **Hoistable Operations**: The operations considered for hoisting include constants, reshapes, and other simple operations like bitcasts, broadcasts, iotas, reverses, slices, transposes, and tuples, provided they meet the criteria for being invariant.

7. **Profitability**: The optimization considers whether hoisting the computation is profitable, meaning it should reduce the computational cost or improve performance without significantly increasing memory usage.

8. **Loop Trip Count**: The loop should have a trip count greater than one, as hoisting is not beneficial for loops that execute zero or one time.

A model that meets these characteristics will trigger the `WhileLoopInvariantCodeMotion` optimization pass, leading to the hoisting of invariant computations outside the while loop, thus potentially improving the model's execution efficiency.
