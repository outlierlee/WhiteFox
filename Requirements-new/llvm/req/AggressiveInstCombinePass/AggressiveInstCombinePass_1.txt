The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// declare variables
ANY_TYPE a = ANY_VALUE; // declare a
ANY_TYPE b = ANY_VALUE; // declare b
ANY_TYPE c = ANY_VALUE; // declare c

// define a function that performs operations leading to truncation
static ANY_TYPE trunc_func(ANY_TYPE a, ANY_TYPE b, ANY_TYPE c) {
  ANY_TYPE result = 0; // declare the result
  RANDOM_CODE; // Do something here with input arguments
  result = (ANY_TYPE)((TRUNC_TYPE)(a OPERATOR b)) OPERATOR c; // perform operations with truncation
  return result;
}

int main() {
  ANY_TYPE main_result = 0; // declare the result
  // invoke the func trunc_func
  main_result = trunc_func(a, b, c);
  printf("%d\n", main_result); // print the result
  return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a call to `trunc_func`, and the result of this call is being used. The `trunc_func` is marked as static and performs operations that involve truncation of data types. The function returns a single `ANY_TYPE` value that is determined by the operations on its arguments. The `ANY_TYPE` could be `int, float, double, etc.`, and the `TRUNC_TYPE` is a smaller data type, such as `char` or `short`, which causes truncation. The `OPERATOR` could be any arithmetic or bitwise operator, such as `+,-,*,/,%,<<,>>,|,&,^`. The `RANDOM_CODE` could be any code that does not affect the truncation logic. Each declared variable should be initialized, such as `int a = 10;`. The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
