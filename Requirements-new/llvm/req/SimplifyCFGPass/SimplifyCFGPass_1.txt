The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 0; // declare and initialize a variable
    int y = 1; // declare and initialize another variable

    // A simple conditional structure that creates an unreachable block
    if (x > y) {
        // This block is unreachable because x is not greater than y
        printf("Unreachable block\n");
    } else {
        // This block is reachable
        printf("Reachable block\n");
    }

    // A loop that never executes, creating another unreachable block
    while (x > y) {
        printf("Unreachable loop block\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there are conditional structures or loops that create unreachable blocks of code. The unreachable blocks are those that cannot be executed due to the logic of the program, such as a condition that is always false. The `main` function must include these unreachable blocks to trigger the optimization. The program should have at least one block of code that is unreachable due to the logic of the program, such as a condition that is always false or a loop that never executes. The presence of these unreachable blocks will allow the optimization to identify and remove them, thus making the boolean variable `Changed` equal to `True`.
