The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <stdatomic.h>

int main() {
  // Declare an atomic integer variable
  atomic_int atomic_var = ANY_INTEGER_VALUE;

  // Perform an atomic read-modify-write operation
  // The operation should be idempotent and not 'Or'
  atomic_fetch_add(&atomic_var, 0); // Example of an idempotent operation

  return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists an atomic read-modify-write operation on an atomic integer variable. The operation should be idempotent, meaning it does not change the value of the variable when applied multiple times with the same operand. The operation should not be `Or`, as the optimization pass will transform it to `Or` with zero. The `atomic_fetch_add` with zero is an example of such an idempotent operation. The `ANY_INTEGER_VALUE` should be an integer value that initializes the atomic variable. The `main` function must return an integer value, typically zero, to indicate successful execution.
