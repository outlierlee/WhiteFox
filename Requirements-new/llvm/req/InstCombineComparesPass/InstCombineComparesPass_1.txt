The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Define a global constant array
const int global_array[] = {ANY_CONSTANT_VALUES}; // The array should have a size less than MaxArraySizeForCombine

int main() {
    // Declare a variable to store the result
    int result = 0;

    // Use a loop or direct access to index into the global array
    for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; ++i) {
        // Perform a comparison operation with a constant
        if (global_array[i] OPERATOR ANY_CONSTANT) {
            // Update the result based on the comparison
            result = i; // or any operation that uses the index
        }
    }

    // Return the result
    return result;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there is a loop or direct access to a global constant array. The program performs a comparison operation on each element of the array with a constant value. The result of the comparison is used to update a variable, which is then returned by the `main` function. The global array should be defined with constant values, and its size should be less than a predefined maximum size (`MaxArraySizeForCombine`). The comparison operation should be such that it can be optimized by the LLVM pass. The `OPERATOR` could be any comparison operator like `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, or `>=`. The `ANY_CONSTANT_VALUES` and `ANY_CONSTANT` should be chosen to match the type of the array elements.
