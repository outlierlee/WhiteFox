The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Define a function that uses stack-allocated variables
void example_function() {
  // Declare variables using alloca
  int a = 0; // Declare and initialize a variable
  int b = 1; // Declare and initialize another variable

  // Use the variables in a way that they can be promoted to registers
  a = a + b; // Simple arithmetic operation
  b = a * 2; // Another operation involving the variables

  // Print the results to ensure the variables are used
  printf("a: %d, b: %d\n", a, b);
}

int main() {
  // Call the function
  example_function();
  return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within a function, variables are allocated on the stack using `alloca` and are used in a manner that allows them to be promoted to registers. The function should perform operations on these variables, such as arithmetic operations, and use them in a way that ensures they are live throughout the function. The `main` function should call this function to ensure the code is executed. The variables should be initialized and used in a straightforward manner, allowing the optimization to identify them as candidates for promotion to registers.
