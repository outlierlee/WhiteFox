The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    // Allocate memory
    char *buffer = (char *)malloc(100);
    if (!buffer) return -1;

    // Perform a store operation
    memset(buffer, 0, 100);

    // Perform another store operation that overwrites the previous one
    memset(buffer, 1, 100);

    // Free the allocated memory
    free(buffer);

    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there are memory allocation and store operations that overwrite previous stores without any intervening reads. The `malloc` function is used to allocate memory, and `memset` is used to perform store operations. The second `memset` overwrites the memory set by the first `memset`, making the first store operation redundant. The `free` function is used to deallocate the memory. The `main` function returns an integer value, typically `0` for successful execution.
