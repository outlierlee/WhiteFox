The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = ANY_VALUE; // declare and initialize x
    int y = ANY_VALUE; // declare and initialize y

    // A loop with a condition that can be constant-folded
    while (x < CONSTANT_CONDITION) {
        // Perform some operations
        x = x OPERATOR y; // x is updated with an operation involving y
    }

    return x; // return the result
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a loop with a condition that can be constant-folded. The loop should have a single latch, meaning it should be structured in a way that LLVM can easily identify and process it. The loop condition should be based on a constant expression that allows LLVM to simplify or eliminate the loop. The loop body should perform operations that update the loop variable, and the result of the loop should be returned by the `main` function. The `OPERATOR` could be any arithmetic or logical operator that modifies the loop variable. The `CONSTANT_CONDITION` should be a constant value that allows the loop condition to be evaluated at compile time. The `ANY_VALUE` should be a value that aligns with the type of the loop variable.
