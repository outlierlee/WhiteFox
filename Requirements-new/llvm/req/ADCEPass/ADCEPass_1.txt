The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// declare variables
int a = 10; // declare and initialize a
int b = 20; // declare and initialize b
int c = 0;  // declare and initialize c

// define a function that performs some operations
int compute(int x, int y) {
  int result = x + y; // perform an operation
  return result; // return the result
}

int main() {
  int main_result = 0; // declare the result

  // perform some operations
  c = a + b; // perform an operation that is not used later

  // invoke the compute function
  main_result = compute(a, b);

  // print the result
  printf("Result: %d\n", main_result);

  return 0; // return the result
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a computation or operation whose result is not used or does not affect the program's output. The `compute` function performs a simple operation and returns a result that is used in the `main` function. However, the operation `c = a + b;` is dead code because the result stored in `c` is never used. This unused computation is a candidate for elimination by the optimization pass. The `main` function must return a value or print a result that is not influenced by the dead code to trigger the optimization.
