The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Declare and initialize floating-point variables
    float x = ANY_FLOAT_VALUE; // e.g., 1.0f
    float y = ANY_FLOAT_VALUE; // e.g., 2.0f
    float z = ANY_FLOAT_VALUE; // e.g., 3.0f
    float w = ANY_FLOAT_VALUE; // e.g., 4.0f

    // Perform a series of floating-point operations
    // The operations should be structured to match the pattern:
    // ((x - y) + z) - w
    float result = ((x - y) + z) - w;

    // Print the result to ensure the computation is used
    printf("Result: %f\n", result);

    return 0;
}
```

### Characteristics of the C Program:

1. **Floating-Point Operations**: The program should involve floating-point arithmetic operations, specifically subtraction and addition.

2. **Expression Pattern**: The expression `((x - y) + z) - w` is crucial. This pattern is designed to match the reassociation logic in the optimization pass, which looks for opportunities to rearrange operations to create more addition instructions and reduce dependency chains.

3. **Variable Initialization**: The variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` should be initialized with any floating-point values. These values can be constants or derived from other computations.

4. **Use of Result**: The result of the computation should be used in some way, such as being printed, to ensure that the compiler does not optimize away the computation entirely.

5. **No Special Attributes**: The program should not involve any special attributes or function calls that would prevent the optimization from being applied, such as functions with special linkage or attributes that prevent reassociation.

By structuring the program in this way, it aligns with the conditions in the optimization pass that look for specific patterns in floating-point arithmetic to apply transformations.
