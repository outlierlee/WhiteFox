The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// declare variables
int a = 10; // declare and initialize a
int b = 0;  // declare and initialize b

int main() {
  int result = 0; // declare the result

  // perform a division operation that will result in a constant expression
  if (b != 0) {
    result = a / b; // this division will be simplified
  } else {
    result = 0; // handle division by zero
  }

  // perform a redundant operation that can be simplified
  int redundant = a * 1; // multiplication by 1 is redundant

  // use the redundant variable in a way that it can be optimized out
  printf("Result: %d, Redundant: %d\n", result, redundant);

  return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there are operations that can be simplified or identified as trivially dead. The program includes a division operation that can be simplified if the divisor is a constant non-zero value. Additionally, it includes a redundant operation, such as multiplication by 1, which can be optimized out. The `main` function uses these operations in a way that allows the optimizer to identify and simplify them, potentially marking them as dead instructions. The program should ensure that the operations are used in a context that allows the optimizer to perform simplifications and dead code elimination.
